  abstract = {We study the infestation dynamics of banana or plantain plants by Radopholus similis, a plant-parasitic nematode that causes severe damages. Two control strategies are implemented in our model: pesticides, which are widely used, and fallows, which are more environmentally friendly. To represent the host-parasite dynamics, two semi-discrete models are proposed. During each cropping season, free nematodes enter the plant roots, on which they feed and reproduce. At the end of the cropping season, fruits are harvested. In the first model, the parent plant is cut down to be replaced by one of its suckers and pesticides are applied. In the second model, the parent plant is uprooted and a fallow period is introduced, inducing the decay of the free pest populations; at the beginning of the next cropping season, a pest-free vitroplant is planted. For both models, the effective reproduction number of pests is computed, assuming that the infestation dynamics are fast compared to the other processes, which leads to the model order reduction. Conditions on the pesticide load or the fallow duration are then derived to ensure the stability of the periodic pest free solution. Finally, numerical simulations illustrate these theoretical results.},

Known facts concerning animal populations have been analysed. systematized. and critically examined. using the experimental and mathematical approaches in the simpler situations. The more outstanding conclusions are listed below. Populations are self-governing systems. They regulate their densities in relation to their own properties and those of their environments. This they do by depleting and impairing essential things to the threshold of favourability, or by maintaining reactive inimical factors, such as the attack of natural enemies, at the limit of tolerance. The mechanism of density governance is almost always intraspecific competition, either amongst the animals for a critically important requisite, or amongst natural enemies for which the animals concerned are requisites. Governing reaction induced by density change holds populations in a state of balance in their environments. The characteristic of balance is sustained and effective compensatory reaction which maintains populations in being in spite of even violent changes in the environment, and which adjusts their densities in general conformity with prevailing conditions. Far from being a stationary state, balance is commonly a state of oscillation about the level of the equilibrium density which is for ever changing with environmental conditions. Destructive factors do not add to mortality when they continue to operate over long periods, but merely cause a redistribution of mortality, for the intensity of competition automatically relaxes sufficiently to make room for the destruction they cause. Such compensatory reaction causes the effect of destructive factors upon density to be much less when balance is reattained than that which they produce when they first operate.},

This was demonstrated in the Leptosphaeria maculans/Brassica napus pathosystem in a 5year recurrent selection field experiment on lines harboring the qualitative resistance gene Rlm6 combined or not with quantitative resistance. The quantitative resistance limited the size of the virulent isolate population. In this study we continued this recurrent selection experiment in the same way to examine whether the pathogen population could adapt and render the major gene ineffective in the longer term. The cultivars Eurol, with a susceptible background, and Darmor, with quantitative resistance, were used. We confirmed that the combination of qualitative and quantitative resistance is an effective approach for controlling the pathogen epidemics over time. This combination did not prevent isolates virulent against the major gene from amplifying in the long term but the quantitative resistance significantly delayed for 5years the loss of effectiveness of the qualitative resistance and disease severity was maintained at a low level on the genotype with both types of resistance after the fungus population had adapted to the major gene. We also showed that diversity of AvrLm6 virulence alleles was comparable in isolates recovered after the recurrent selection on lines carrying either the major gene alone or in combination with quantitative resistance: a single repeat-induced point mutation and deletion events were observed in both situations. Breeding varieties which combine qualitative and quantitative resistance can effectively contribute to disease control by increasing the potential for durability of major resistance genes.},

We report the draft genome sequence of the root-knot nematode \emph{Meloidogyne} \emph{incognita}, a biotrophic parasite of many crops, including tomato, cotton and coffee. Most of the assembled sequence of this asexually reproducing nematode, totaling 86 Mb, exists in pairs of homologous but divergent segments. This suggests that ancient allelic regions in M. \emph{incognita} are evolving toward effective haploidy, permitting new mechanisms of adaptation. The number and diversity of plant cell wall-degrading enzymes in M. \emph{incognita} is unprecedented in any animal for which a genome sequence is available, and may derive from multiple horizontal gene transfers from bacterial sources. Our results provide insights into the adaptations required by metazoans to successfully parasitize immunocompetent plants, and open the way for discovering new antiparasitic strategies.},

Here we present a general epidemiological model for plant diseases, formulated to study the evolution of phenotypic traits of plant pathogens in response to host resistance. The model was used to analyse how the characteristics of the disease resistance, and the method of deployment, affect the size and duration of the gain. The gain obtained from growing a resistant cultivar, compared to a susceptible cultivar, was quantified as the increase in green canopy area resulting from control of foliar disease, integrated over many years\textemdash{}termed `Healthy Area Duration (HAD) Gain'. Previous work has suggested that the effect of crop ratio (the proportion of land area occupied by the resistant crop) on the gain from qualitative (gene-for-gene) resistance is negligible. Increasing the crop ratio increases the area of uninfected host, but the resistance is more rapidly broken; these two effects counteract each other. We tested the hypothesis that similar counteracting effects would occur for quantitative, multi-genic resistance, but found that the HAD Gain increased at higher crop ratios. Then we tested the hypothesis that the gain from quantitative host resistance could differ depending on the life-cycle component (sporulation rate or infection efficiency) constrained by the resistance. For the patho-system considered, a quantitative resistant cultivar that reduced the infection efficiency gave a greater HAD Gain than a cultivar that reduced sporulation rate, despite having equivalent transmission rates.},

This, in turn, requires fusion of population genetics and epidemiology at a range of scales from the field to the landscape and even to continental deployment of control measures. It also requires an understanding of economic and social constraints that influence the deployment of control. Here I propose an epidemiological framework to model invasion, persistence and variability of epidemics that encompasses a wide range of scales and topologies through which disease spreads. By considering how to map control methods onto epidemiological parameters and variables, some new approaches towards optimizing the efficiency of control at the landscape scale are introduced. Epidemiological strategies to minimize the risks of failure of chemical and genetical control are presented and some consequences of heterogeneous selection pressures in time and space on the persistence and evolutionary changes of the pathogen population are discussed. Finally, some approaches towards embedding epidemiological models for the deployment of control in an economically plausible framework are presented.},

Biomedical science is clearly the premier science of the foreseeable future. For the continuing health of their subject mathematicians must become involved with biology. With the example of how mathematics has benefited from and influenced physics, it is clear that if mathematicians do not become involved in the biosciences they will simply not be a part of what are likely to be the most important and exciting scientific discoveries of all time. Mathematical biology is a fast growing, well recognised, albeit not clearly defined, subject and is, to my mind, the most exciting modern application of mathematics. The increasing use of mathematics in biology is inevitable as biol ogy becomes more quantitative. The complexity of the biological sciences makes interdisciplinary involvement essential. For the mathematician, biology opens up new and exciting branches while for the biologist mathematical modelling offers another research tool commmensurate with a new powerful laboratory technique but only if used appropriately and its limitations recognised. However, the use of esoteric mathematics arrogantly applied to biological problems by mathemati cians who know little about the real biology, together with unsubstantiated claims as to how important such theories are, does little to promote the interdisciplinary involvement which is so essential. Mathematical biology research, to be useful and interesting, must be relevant biologically.},

  abstract = {The sustainable use of multicomponent treatments such as combination therapies, combination vaccines/chemicals, and plants carrying multigenic resistance requires an understanding of how their population-wide deployment affects the speed of the pathogen adaptation. Here, we develop a stochastic model describing the emergence of a mutant pathogen and its dynamics in a heterogeneous host population split into various types by the management strategy. Based on a multi-type Markov birth and death process, the model can be used to provide a basic understanding of how the life-cycle parameters of the pathogen population, and the controllable parameters of a management strategy affect the speed at which a pathogen adapts to a multicomponent treatment. Our results reveal the importance of coupling stochastic mutation and migration processes, and illustrate how their stochasticity can alter our view of the principles of managing pathogen adaptive dynamics at the population level. In particular, we identify the growth and migration rates that allow pathogens to adapt to a multicomponent treatment even if it is deployed on only small proportions of the host. In contrast to the accepted view, our model suggests that treatment durability should not systematically be identified with mutation cost. We show also that associating a multicomponent treatment with defeated monocomponent treatments can be more durable than associating it with intermediate treatments including only some of the components. We conclude that the explicit modelling of stochastic processes underlying evolutionary dynamics could help to elucidate the principles of the sustainable use of multicomponent treatments in population-wide management strategies intended to impede the evolution of harmful populations.},

We unfold the network of selective pressures and derive how these depend on physiological costs, eco-evolutionary feedbacks, and a complex interaction between the evolving traits. Our analysis highlights habitat saturation, both around individuals (local aggregation) and around unoccupied space (local contention), as the key mediator of altruism and mobility evolution. Once altruism and mobility are allowed to evolve jointly, three general insights emerge. First, the cost of mobility affects the origin of altruism, determining whether and how quickly selfishness is overcome. Second, the cost of altruism determines which of two qualitatively different routes to sociality are taken: an evolutionary reduction of mobility, resulting in higher habitat saturation, is either preceded or followed by the adaptive rise of altruism. Third, contrary to conventional expectations, a positive correlation between evolutionarily stable levels of altruism and mobility can arise; this is expected when comparing populations that evolved under different constraints on mobility or that differ in other life-history traits.},

Such mixtures are more useful under some epidemiological conditions than under others, and experimental methodology, especially problems of scale, may be crucial in evaluating the potential efficacy of mixtures on disease. There are now examples of mixtures providing both low and high degrees of disease control for a wide range of pathosystems, including crops with large plants, and pathogens that demonstrate low host specificity, or are splash dispersed, soilborne, or insect vectored. Though most analyses of pathogen evolution in mixtures consider static costs of virulence to be the main mechanism countering selection for pathogen complexity, many other potential mechanisms need to be investigated. Agronomic and marketing considerations must be carefully evaluated when implementing mixture approaches to crop management. Practical difficulties associated with mixtures have often been overestimated, however, and mixtures will likely play an increasingly important role as we develop more sustainable agricultural systems.},

An understanding of coevolution between hosts and parasites leads to predictors of potentially durable resistance, such as corresponding virulence having a high fitness cost to the pathogen or resistance being common in natural populations. High partial resistance can also promote durability. Whether or not resistance is actually durable, however, depends on ecological and epidemiological processes that stabilize genetic polymorphism, many of which are absent from intensive agriculture. There continues to be no biological, genetic, or economic model for durable resistance. The analogy between plant breeding and natural selection indicates that the basic requirements are genetic variation in potentially durable resistance, effective and consistent selection for resistance, and an efficient breeding process in which trials of disease resistance are integrated with other traits. Knowledge about genetics and mechanisms can support breeding for durable resistance once these fundamentals are in place.},

Thus, a critical challenge in plant pathology and epidemiology is to design durable and effective strategies to protect cropping systems from damage caused by pathogens. Theoretical studies suggest that spatio-temporal variation in the diversity and distribution of resistant hosts across agricultural landscapes may have strong effects on the epidemiology and evolutionary potential of crop pathogens. However, we lack empirical tests of spatio-temporal deployment of host resistance to pathogens can be best used to manage disease epidemics and disrupt pathogen evolutionary dynamics in real-world systems. In a field experiment, we simulated how differences in Brassica napus resistance deployment strategies and landscape connectivity influence epidemic severity and Leptosphaeria maculans pathogen population composition. Host plant resistance, spatio-temporal connectivity [stubble loads], and genetic connectivity of the inoculum source [composition of canola stubble mixtures] jointly impacted epidemiology (disease severity) and pathogen evolution (population composition). Changes in population composition were consistent with directional selection for the ability to infect the host (infectivity), leading to changes in pathotype (multilocus phenotypes) and infectivity frequencies. We repeatedly observed decreases in the frequency of unnecessary infectivity, suggesting that carrying multiple infectivity genes is costly for the pathogen. From an applied perspective, our results indicate that varying resistance genes in space and time can be used to help control disease, even when resistance has already been overcome. Furthermore, our approach extends our ability to test not only for the efficacy of host varieties in a given year, but also for durability over multiple cropping seasons, given variation in the combination of resistance genes deployed.},

To ascertain this hypothesis, five pepper inbred lines, differing in their quantitative resistance level, were combined with Me1 or Me3 genes in F1 hybrids. The resistance of inbred lines and F1 hybrids was evaluated in a greenhouse with soil naturally infected by M. \emph{incognita} in two successive growing years.

An increase in nematode infection was observed in the second growing year in lines carrying Me1 or Me3, independently of quantitative resistance.

By reviewing theoretical models and experimental studies, we show that higher levels of heterogeneity of selection are associated with longer-term sustainability of pest or pathogen control. The combination of molecules usually outcompetes other resistance management strategies, such as Responsive alternation, Periodic application, or Mosaic, because it ensures `multiple intragenerational killing'. A strategic deployment over space and/or time of several combinations can ensure `multiple intergenerational killing', further delaying the evolution of resistance.},

  abstract = {Plant resistance is currently the most effective and environmentally safe method to control plant parasitic nematodes (PPNs). Resistance genes generally act against sedentary PPNs by inducing a hypersensitive reaction that prevents the parasite installation and/or reproduction. However, the recent emergence of virulent biotypes able to overcome the plant resistance genes may constitute a severe limitation to this control strategy. In selection experiments conducted under controled environment, the genetic variation, specificity and inheritance of nematode virulence have been demonstrated. Moreover, the occurrence of gene-for-gene interactions has been shown in a few cases. Moleculars markers have been extensively used to investigate the genetic variability of PPNs, but so far, the genomic polymorphisms observed are largely independent of virulence. Such data suggest that, within a species, virulent isolates do not share a common origin, but are probably the result of independent mutational events. To understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for virulence in PPNs, several strategies have been developed, in relation with their mode of reproduction (parthenogenesis versus amphimixis). As an example, recent results obtained in our laboratory on the root-knot nematodes \emph{Meloidogyne} spp. are presented. On a more general point of view, factors that may induce stable genome variability in PPNs, e.g. Transposition of mobile elements and chromosomal rearrangements (leading to polyploidy, aneuploidy, etc) will also be considered. Advances in knowledge in these areas should have important consequences for the management and durability of natural resistance genes, and for the engineering of new forms of resistance.},

Nematode densities were determined at the beginning and end of each crop. Yield was assessed in eight plants per plot weekly for 6 weeks. The P f/P i values were 0.28 and 21.6 after three crops of resistant or susceptible cultivars, respectively. Growth of resistant as opposed to susceptible tomato cultivars in non-fumigated soil increased profits by 30,000 euros ha-1. The resistant Monika in non-fumigated soil yielded similarly (P $>$ 0.05) to the susceptible Durinta in methyl bromide fumigated soil but the resistant tomato provided a benefit of 8800 euros ha-1 over the susceptible one because of the cost of fumigation. Selection for virulence did not occur, although the nematode population subjected to the resistant cultivar for three consecutive seasons produced four times more eggs than the population on the susceptible one. Such a difference was also shown when the resistant cultivar was subjected to high continuous inoculum pressure for 14 weeks. The Mi-resistance gene can be an effective and economic alternative to methyl bromide in plastic-houses infested with root-knot nematodes, but should be used in an integrated management context to preserve its durability and prevent the selection of virulent populations due to variability in isolate reproduction and environmental conditions.},

  abstract = {Durable resistance to disease is a common component of plant defense systems in natural ecosystems and can be found in virtually all cultivated species. Agricultural production practices increase crop vulnerability to most diseases, so higher levels of resistance than occur in natural ecosystems may be needed. Monogenic resistance to highly specialized pathogens is often highly effective when first developed but is generally race-specific and nondurable, especially when characterized by hypersensitive host reactions. Partial resistance conditioned by several to many genes with additive effects is usually durable, particularly when it involves morphological or developmental changes in the plant. Exceptions to the general rule of nondurable monogenic resistance and durable polygenic resistance are presented. Recurrent selection is commonly used to develop cultivars with durable resistance, but durable resistance has also been achieved through pedigree breeding in small grains. Success in accumulating polygenic durable resistance to multiple diseases of maize and to leaf rust and stripe rust of wheat are described as the mixed record of success in breeding for late blight resistance in potato. The mlo gene for resistance to powdery mildew in barley offers an intriguing case of highly effective monogenic resistance that appears to be durable. Modern molecular genetic approaches offer promise not only for marker-assisted selection of partial resistance genes but also for creation of novel forms of resistance to plant diseases. Nevertheless, traditional breeding and field tests will still have an essential role in developing commercial cultivars.},

Because methyl bromide has provided a reliable return on investment for nematode control, many of these commodities have standardized their production practices based on the use of this chemical and will be negatively impacted if effective and economical alternatives are not identified. Alternative control measures based on other chemicals, genetic resistance, and cultural practices require a greater knowledge of nematode biology to achieve satisfactory results. Here, we provide an overview of nematode management practices that we believe will be relied upon heavily in U.S. high-value crop production systems in a world without methyl bromide. Included are case studies of U.S. high-value crop production systems to demonstrate how nematode management practices other than methyl bromide may be incorporated.},

  abstract = {A seasonal model, where a growing season is defined as the time between sowing and harvest and alternates with an inter-crop period, was derived to study the effects of the `cost of virulence' and cropping ratio on durability of resistance. We assumed a single strain of virulent pathogen, a single strain of avirulent pathogen and two cultivars (one resistant and one susceptible) and studied two measures of durability of resistance (`take-over time' and `usefulness time'). Take-over time is defined as the time needed for the virulent strain of the pathogen to reach a preset threshold and predominate over the previous pathogen population. Usefulness time is the time needed before the estimated gain in green canopy area duration per plant through the use of the resistant cultivar becomes negligible. The model suggested that, although it could take several seasons before the virulent strain of the pathogen predominated over the previous pathogen population, the usefulness time of the resistant cultivar was always much shorter. Furthermore, increasing selection for the virulent strain of the pathogen (through increasing the cropping ratio of the resistant cultivar) caused the virulent strain of the pathogen to invade the system more rapidly. Cost of virulence, reflecting differences in pathogen infection rates between the four possible combinations of cultivar/pathogen strain, significantly affected durability of resistance, with the dynamics of the virulent and avirulent strains ranging from a case where the virulent strain of the pathogen died out to a case where the virulent strain of the pathogen invaded the resident pathogen population. An intermediate state, where the system reached equilibrium and the virulent strain of the pathogen neither became predominant nor died out, was defined as `coexistence' of both strains of the pathogen. Occurrence of coexistence was directly related to the cost of virulence since it did not occur when virulence of the pathogen did not have a fitness cost. Two methods to include cost of virulence in the model gave similar results in relation to the two measures of durability of resistance studied.},

Here, a model is proposed to investigate how these processes lead to the emergence of plant viral genotypes breaking down qualitative resistance genes. At the individual plant scale, selection, drift and mutation processes shape the evolution of viral populations from a set of differential equations. The spatial segregation of virus genotypes in their hosts is also considered. At the host population scale, the epidemiological dynamics is given by an individual-based algorithm. Global sensitivity analyses allowed ranking the ten demo-genetic and epidemiological parameters of the model according to their impact on the mean and variance of the risk of breakdown of a plant resistance. Demo-genetic parameters (number and nature of mutations involved in breakdown, fitness of mutant genotypes) had the largest impact on the mean breakdown risk, whereas epidemiological parameters had more influence on its standard deviation. It is discussed how these results can be used to choose the potentially most durable resistance genes among a pool of candidates. Finally, our analyses point out the parameters which should be estimated more precisely to improve durability predictions.},

  abstract = {Key message The plant genetic background influences the efficiency of major resistance genes to root-knot nematodes in pepper and has to be considered in breeding strategies. Root-knot nematodes (RKNs), \emph{Meloidogyne} spp., are extremely polyphagous plant parasites worldwide. Since the use of most chemical nematicides is being prohibited, genetic resistance is an efficient alternative way to protect crops against these pests. However, nematode populations proved able to breakdown plant resistance, and genetic resources in terms of resistance genes (R-genes) are limited. Sustainable management of these valuable resources is thus a key point of R-gene durability. In pepper, Me1 and Me3 are two dominant major R-genes, currently used in breeding programs to control M. arenaria, M. \emph{incognita} and M. javanica, the three main RKN species. These two genes differ in the hypersensitive response induced by nematode infection. In this study, they were introgressed in either a susceptible or a partially resistant genetic background, in either homozygous or heterozygous allelic status. Challenging these genotypes with an avirulent M. \emph{incognita} isolate demonstrated that (1) the efficiency of the R-genes in reducing the reproductive potential of RKNs is strongly affected by the plant genetic background, (2) the allelic status of the R-genes has no effect on nematode reproduction. These results highlight the primary importance of the choice of both the R-gene and the genetic background into which it is introgressed during the selection of new elite cultivars by plant breeders.},

Although they both suppressed nematode reproduction, the two resistance genes induced very different response patterns. First, significantly fewer J2 were able to invade roots of HDA149 compared to HDA330. Second, while ultrastructural changes typical to the hypersensitive reaction (HR) occurred in root cells of HDA149 early after nematode inoculation (i.e. necrosis of cells directly involved in nematode penetration and feeding), the resistance mechanism in HDA330 involved a delayed plant response (i.e. cell senescence and death) which took place after the induction of a number of (imperfect) giant cells by the nematode. These differential responses are discussed in relation to the nematode ability to circumvent or not the resistance gene(s), and it is suggested that such virulence could result from the overcoming by the J2 of the early HR occurring within the epidermis and cortex of the root.

  abstract = {Vegetable production makes an intensive use of pesticides, and a major challenge is to build alternative cropping systems that can control pests and diseases with fewer uses of chemical products. An on-farm analysis was conducted in Southeast France to assess the efficacy of several cropping systems in simultaneously controlling two major pests: root-knot nematodes (\emph{Meloidogyne} spp.) and lettuce drop due to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. Ten cropping systems resulting from the combinations of three crop sequences and two alternative techniques, solarization and green manure, were assessed during two years. The use of solarization once a year or once every two years limited the occurrence of S. sclerotiorum. Sorghum green manure tended to increase S. sclerotiorum incidence; the effect was positively correlated with green manure duration. Especially when no vegetable was cropped in summer, the green manure crop duration was lengthened and this probably created soil conditions favorable to the development of the fungus. The incidence of root-knot nematodes was largely dependent on crop rotation: a melon crop in summer increased its incidence on the subsequent lettuce crops whereas a summer sorghum cover crop had no effect. The cropping systems that limited Sclerotinia development in soil tended to support the root-knot nematode populations. These results should motivate farmers and advisers to adopt a systemic analysis and take into account the various interactions among inoculum level, soil characteristics, crop rotations, and technical management options for designing sustainable vegetable production systems.

By reviewing theoretical models and experimental studies, we show that higher levels of heterogeneity of selection are associated with longer-term sustainability of pest or pathogen control. The combination of molecules usually outcompetes other resistance management strategies, such as Responsive alternation, Periodic application, or Mosaic, because it ensures `multiple intragenerational killing'. A strategic deployment over space and/or time of several combinations can ensure `multiple intergenerational killing', further delaying the evolution of resistance.},

It showed that in the Provence-Alpes-C\^ote d'Azur (PACA) region, more than 40\% of horticultural holdings are infested by \emph{Meloidogyne} species. It is no longer possible to produce cucurbits on certain plots. Other regions are also affected.

  abstract = {Background: Resistant cultivars are key elements for pathogen control and pesticide reduction, but their repeated use may lead to the emergence of virulent pathogen populations, able to overcome the resistance. Increased research efforts, mainly based on theoretical studies, explore spatio-temporal deployment strategies of resistance genes in order to maximize their durability. We evaluated experimentally three of these strategies to control root-knot nematodes: cultivar mixtures, alternating and pyramiding resistance genes, under controlled and field conditions over a 3-years period, assessing the efficiency and the durability of resistance in a protected crop rotation system with pepper as summer crop and lettuce as winter crop. Results: The choice of the resistance gene and the genetic background in which it is introgressed, affected the frequency of resistance breakdown. The pyramiding of two different resistance genes in one genotype suppressed the emergence of virulent isolates. Alternating different resistance genes in rotation was also efficient to decrease virulent populations in fields due to the specificity of the virulence and the trapping effect of resistant plants. Mixing resistant cultivars together appeared as a less efficient strategy to control nematodes. Conclusions: This work provides experimental evidence that, in a cropping system with seasonal sequences of vegetable species, pyramiding or alternating resistance genes benefit yields in the long-term by increasing the durability of resistant cultivars and improving the long-term control of a soil-borne pest. To our knowledge, this result is the first one obtained for a plant-nematode interaction, which helps demonstrate the general applicability of such strategies for breeding and sustainable management of resistant cultivars against pathogens.},

After 135 days, growth was also decreased significantly by Pi = 0.8 and 4.0 eggs/g soil. The decrease in growth was proportionally much greater after 135 days than after 42 days, as was reflected by the estimated values of rn (the minimum yield), T (the tolerance limit) or z (a constant close to 1.0 which reflects the damage caused by a single nematode or where several generations are involved, all its progeny). The increased damage after 135 days was associated with a greatly increased final population density (PS) of M. \emph{incognita}. The greatest increase in population density (Pf/Pi = 273) occurred at the lowest effective initial population density used (Pi = 0.03 eggs/g soil), but the greatest final population (Pf= 90 000 nematodes/pot) occurred with Pi = 0.16 viable eggs/g soil.

Resistant and susceptible cultivars must be strategically associated according to the principles of cultivar mixture (within a season) and rotation (between seasons). We explored these questions by modeling the evolutionary and epidemiological processes shaping the dynamics of a pathogen population in a landscape composed of a seasonal cultivated compartment and a reservoir compartment hosting pathogen year-round. Optimal deployment strategies depended mostly on the molecular basis of plant-pathogen interactions and on the agro-ecological context before resistance deployment, particularly epidemic intensity and landscape connectivity. Mixtures were much more efficient in landscapes in which between-field infections and infections originating from the reservoir were more prevalent than within-field infections. Resistance genes requiring two mutations of the pathogen avirulence gene to be broken down, rather than one, were particularly useful when infections from the reservoir predominated. Combining mixture and rotation principles were better than the use of the same mixture each season as (i) they controlled epidemics more effectively insituations in which within-field infections or infections from the reservoir were frequent and (ii) they fulfilled the epidemiological and evolutionary perspectives.},

  abstract = {(1) One of the most striking features in the study of epidemics is the difficulty of finding a causal factor which appears to be adequate to account for the magnitude of the frequent epidemics of disease which visit almost every population. It was with a view to obtaining more insight regarding the effects of the various factors which govern the spread of contagious epidemics that the present investigation was undertaken. Reference may here be made to the work of Ross and Hudson (1915-17) in which the same problem is attacked. The problem is here carried to a further stage, and it is considered from a point of view which is in one sense more general. The problem may be summarised as follows: One (or more) infected person is introduced into a community of individuals, more or less susceptible to the disease in question. The disease spreads from the affected to the unaffected by contact infection. Each infected person runs through the course of his sickness, and finally is removed from the number of those who are sick, by recovery or by death. The chances of recovery or death vary from day to day during the course of his illness. The chances that the affected may convey infection to the unaffected are likewise dependent upon the stage of the sickness. As the epidemic spreads, the number of unaffected members of the community becomes reduced. Since the course of an epidemic is short compared with the life of an individual, the population may be considered as remaining constant, except in as far as it is modified by deaths due to the epidemic disease itself. In the course of time the epidemic may come to an end. One of the most important probems in epidemiology is to ascertain whether this termination occurs only when no susceptible individuals are left, or whether the interplay of the various factors of infectivity, recovery and mortality, may result in termination, whilst many susceptible individuals are still present in the unaffected population. It is difficult to treat this problem in its most general aspect. In the present communication discussion will be limited to the case in which all members of the community are initially equally susceptible to the disease, and it will be further assumed that complete immunity is conferred by a single infection.},

Here, we theoretically explored how farmers main leverages (resistant cultivar choice, resistance deployment strategy, landscape planning and cultural practices) can be best combined to achieve resistance durability while minimizing yield losses as a result of plant viruses. Assuming a gene-for-gene type of interaction, virus epidemics are modelled in a landscape composed of a mosaic of resistant and susceptible fields, subjected to seasonality, and a reservoir hosting viruses year-round. The model links the genetic and the epidemiological processes, shaping at nested scales the demogenetic dynamics of viruses. The choice of the resistance gene (characterized by the equilibrium frequency of the resistance-breaking virus at mutation-selection balance in a susceptible plant) is the most influential leverage of action. Our results showed that optimal strategies of resistance deployment range from mixture (where susceptible and resistant cultivars coexist) to pure strategies (with only resistant cultivar) depending on the resistance characteristics and the epidemiological context (epidemic incidence and landscape connectivity). We demonstrate and discuss gaps concerning virus epidemiology across the agro-ecological interface that must be filled to achieve sustainable disease management.},

Eradication attempts often involve removal of host plants within a certain radius of detection, targeting asymptomatic infection. Here we develop and test potentially more effective, epidemiologically motivated, control strategies, using a mathematical model previously fitted to the spread of citrus canker in Florida. We test risk-based control, which preferentially removes hosts expected to cause a high number of infections in the remaining host population. Removals then depend on past patterns of pathogen spread and host removal, which might be nontransparent to affected stakeholders. This motivates a variable radius strategy, which approximates risk-based control via removal radii that vary by location, but which are fixed in advance of any epidemic. Risk-based control outperforms variable radius control, which in turn outperforms constant radius removal. This result is robust to changes in disease spread parameters and initial patterns of susceptible host plants. However, efficiency degrades if epidemiological parameters are incorrectly characterised. Risk-based control including additional epidemiology can be used to improve disease management, but it requires good prior knowledge for optimal performance. This focuses attention on gaining maximal information from past epidemics, on understanding model transferability between locations and on adaptive management strategies that change over time.},

A wide range of models differing in mathematical sophistication and computational complexity has been proposed as a means of achieving a greater understanding of epidemiology and carrying this through to improved management. The potential exists to align these modeling approaches to evaluation of control practices and prediction of the consequent epidemic outcomes, but these have yet to make a major impact on practical disease management. For the immediate future simpler pragmatic approaches for analysis of disease progress, using nonlinear growth functions and/or integrated measures such as area under disease progress curves, will play a key role in informing tactical and strategic decisions on control treatments. These approaches have proved useful in describing control effectiveness and, in some cases, optimizing or changing control practices.},

Plants were field-grown from transplants, produced with either top or bottom irrigation, or from direct seeding using either primed or raw seeds. Dry weights were determined every 2 weeks beginning at 30 days post-planting. Root growth was measured at two soil levels, 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm and in three 10-cm wide positions within each level. Transplants and direct seeded plants had 150 and 100\%, respectively, greater root mass in the upper than in the lower soil level. Root growth increase over 56 days was linear for transplants while in direct seeded plants root growth had a lag phase of approximately 14 days, with a sharp increase thereafter. At the end of the growth period, fruit, stem, leaf and root dry weight accounted for 66, 11, 19 and 4\% for transplants and 39, 16, 33 and 12\% for direct seeded plants. The coordination of growth between root and shoot changed after fruit set only in transplants, which indicates that transplants exhibited a greater fruit sink demand and fruit production than seeded plants.},

  abstract = {Seasonality, or periodic host absence, is a central feature in plant epidemiology. In this respect, seasonal plant epidemic models take into account the way the parasite overwinters and generates new infections. These are termed primary infections. In the literature, one finds two classes of models: high-dimensional elaborate models and low-dimensional compact models, where primary infection dynamics are explicit and implicit, respectively. Investigating a compact model allowed previous authors to show the existence of a competitive exclusion principle. However, the way compact models derive from elaborate models has not been made explicit yet. This makes it unclear whether results such as competitive exclusion extend to elaborate models as well. Here, we show that assuming primary infection dynamics are fast in a standard elaborate model translates into a compact form. Yet, it is not that usually found in the literature. Moreover, we numerically show that coexistence is possible in this original compact form. Reversing the question, we show that the usual compact form approximates an alternate elaborate model, which differs from the earlier one in that primary infection dynamics are density dependent. We discuss to which extent these results shed light on coexistence within soil- and air-borne plant parasites, such as within the take-all disease of wheat and the grapevine powdery mildew cryptic species complexes, respectively.},

  abstract = {A continuous-time and deterministic model was used to characterize plant virus disease epidemics in relation to virus transmission mechanism and population dynamics of the insect vectors. The model can be written as a set of linked differential equations for healthy (virus-free), latently infected, infectious, and removed (postinfectious) plant categories, and virus-free, latent, and infective insects, with parameters based on the transmission classes, vector population dynamics, immigration/emigration rates, and virus-plant interactions. The rate of change in diseased plants is a function of the density of infective insects, the number of plants visited per time, and the probability of transmitting the virus per plant visit. The rate of change in infective insects is a function of the density of infectious plants, the number of plants visited per time by an insect, and the probability of acquiring the virus per plant visit. Numerical solutions of the differential equations were used to determine transitional and steady-state levels of disease incidence (d*); d* was also determined directly from the model parameters. Clear differences were found in disease development among the four transmission classes: nonpersistently transmitted (stylet-borne [NP]); semipersistently transmitted (foregut-borne [SP]); circulative, persistently transmitted (CP); and propagative, persistently transmitted (PP), with the highest disease incidence (d) for the SP and CP classes relative to the others, especially at low insect density when there was no insect migration or when the vector status of emigrating insects was the same as that of immigrating ones. The PP and CP viruses were most affected by changes in vector longevity, rates of acquisition, and inoculation of the virus by vectors, whereas the PP viruses were least affected by changes in insect mobility. When vector migration was explicitly considered, results depended on the fraction of infective insects in the immigration pool and the fraction of dying and emigrating vectors replaced by immigrants. The PP and CP viruses were most sensitive to changes in these factors. Based on model parameters, the basic reproductive number (R0)\textemdash number of new infected plants resulting, from an infected plant introduced into a susceptible plant population\textemdash was derived for some circumstances and used to determine the steady-state level of disease incidence and an approximate exponential rate of disease increase early in the epidemic. Results can be used to evaluate disease management strategies.},

Often, estimation of the parameters is precarious because nematode measurements, although laborious and expensive, are imprecise and the range in initial densities may be small. The estimation procedure can be improved by using orthogonal regression with a parameter for initial density on each experimental unit. In multi-year experiments parameters of a dynamic model can be estimated with optimization techniques like Simulated annealing or Bayesian Methods Such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). With these algorithms information from different experiments can be combined. In multi-year dynamic models, the stability of the stead), states is an important issue. With chaotic dynamics, prediction of densities and associated economic loss will be possible only on a short timescale. In this Study, a generic model was developed that describes population dynamics in crop rotations. Mathematical analysis showed stable steady states (to exist for this dynamic model. Using the Metropolis algorithm, the model was fitted to data from a multi-year experiment on Pratylenchus penetrans dynamics with treatments that varied between years. For three crops, parameters for a yield loss assessment model were available and gross margin of the six possible rotations comprising these three crops and a fallow year were compared at the steady state of nematode density. Sensitivity of mean gross margin to changes in the parameter estimates was investigated. We discuss the general applicability of the dynamic rotation model and the opportunities arising from combination of the model with Bayesian calibration techniques for more efficient utilization and collection of data relevant For economic evaluation of crop rotations.},

Based on an agronomic point of view, the analysis focuses on a description of agricultural factors and practices, rather than on biological processes. Several alternative techniques are considered, including sanitation, soil management, organic amendments, fertilization, biological control and heat-based methods. We analyzed the effects of each practice and interactions among techniques and found large variations among studies. Many practices are only partially effective for nematode control; thus, combining control methods in a systemic analysis presents a challenge.

In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that a fitness cost may be associated with nematode virulence, using the interaction between the parthenogenetic species \emph{Meloidogyne} \emph{incognita} and tomato as a model system. The reproductive parameters of near-isogenic lines of the nematode, selected for avirulence or virulence against the tomato Mi resistance gene, were analysed and combined into a reproductive index that was taken as a measure of fitness. The lower fitness of the virulent lines on the susceptible tomato cultivar showed for the first time that a measurable fitness cost is associated with unnecessary virulence in the nematode. Although parthenogenesis should theoretically lead to little genetic variability, such cost may impose a direct constraint on the coevolution between the plant and the nematode populations, and suggests an adaptive significance of trade-offs between selected characters and fitness-related traits. These results indicate that, although plant resistance can be broken, it might prove durable in some conditions if the virulent nematodes are counterselected in susceptible plants, which could have important consequences for the management of resistant cultivars in the field.},

Here, we project global demand for crop production in 2050 and evaluate the environmental impacts of alternative ways that this demand might be met. We find that per capita demand for crops, when measured as caloric or protein content of all crops combined, has been a similarly increasing function of per capita real income since 1960. This relationship forecasts a 100\textendash{}110\% increase in global crop demand from 2005 to 2050. Quantitative assessments show that the environmental impacts of meeting this demand depend on how global agriculture expands. If current trends of greater agricultural intensification in richer nations and greater land clearing (extensification) in poorer nations were to continue, $\sim$1 billion ha of land would be cleared globally by 2050, with CO2-C equivalent greenhouse gas emissions reaching $\sim$3 Gt y-1 and N use $\sim$250 Mt y-1 by then. In contrast, if 2050 crop demand was met by moderate intensification focused on existing croplands of underyielding nations, adaptation and transfer of high-yielding technologies to these croplands, and global technological improvements, our analyses forecast land clearing of only $\sim$0.2 billion ha, greenhouse gas emissions of $\sim$1 Gt y-1, and global N use of $\sim$225 Mt y-1. Efficient management practices could substantially lower nitrogen use. Attainment of high yields on existing croplands of underyielding nations is of great importance if global crop demand is to be met with minimal environmental impacts.},

Abstract = {{Under the current scenario of rapid human population increase, achieving
   efficient and productive agricultural land use while conserving
   biodiversity is a global challenge. There is an ongoing debate whether
   land for nature and for production should be segregated (land sparing)
   or integrated on the same land (land sharing, wildlife-friendly
   farming). While recent studies argue for agricultural intensification in
   a land sparing approach, we suggest here that it fails to account for
   real-world complexity. We argue that agriculture practiced under
   smallholder farmer-dominated landscapes and not large-scale farming, is
   currently the backbone of global food security in the developing world.
   Furthermore, contemporary food usage is inefficient with one third
   wasted and a further third used inefficiently to feed livestock and that
   conventional intensification causes often overlooked environmental
   costs. A major argument for wildlife friendly farming and agroecological
   intensification is that crucial ecosystem services are provided by
   ``planned{''} and ``associated{''} biodiversity, whereas the land
   sparing concept implies that biodiversity in agroecosystems is
   functionally negligible. However, loss of biological control can result
   in dramatic increases of pest densities, pollinator services affect a
   third of global human food supply, and inappropriate agricultural
   management can lead to environmental degradation. Hence, the true value
   of functional biodiversity on the farm is often inadequately
   acknowledged or understood, while conventional intensification tends to
   disrupt beneficial functions of biodiversity. In conclusion, linking
   agricultural intensification with biodiversity conservation and hunger
   reduction requires well-informed regional and targeted solutions,
   something which the land sparing vs sharing debate has failed to achieve
   so far. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Recent analyses have highlighted the likely dual health and environmental benefits of reducing the fraction of animal-sourced foods in our diets. Here, we couple for the first time, to our knowledge, a region-specific global health model based on dietary and weight-related risk factors with emissions accounting and economic valuation modules to quantify the linked health and environmental consequences of dietary changes. We find that the impacts of dietary changes toward less meat and more plant-based diets vary greatly among regions. The largest absolute environmental and health benefits result from diet shifts in developing countries whereas Western high-income and middle-income countries gain most in per capita terms. Transitioning toward more plant-based diets that are in line with standard dietary guidelines could reduce global mortality by 6\textendash{}10\% and food-related greenhouse gas emissions by 29\textendash{}70\% compared with a reference scenario in 2050. We find that the monetized value of the improvements in health would be comparable with, or exceed, the value of the environmental benefits although the exact valuation method used considerably affects the estimated amounts. Overall, we estimate the economic benefits of improving diets to be 1\textendash{}31 trillion US dollars, which is equivalent to 0.4\textendash{}13\% of global gross domestic product (GDP) in 2050. However, significant changes in the global food system would be necessary for regional diets to match the dietary patterns studied here.},

Therefore, humanity needs to address anthropogenic population extirpation and decimation immediately. That conclusion is based on analyses of the numbers and degrees of range contraction (indicative of population shrinkage and/or population extinctions according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature) using a sample of 27,600 vertebrate species, and on a more detailed analysis documenting the population extinctions between 1900 and 2015 in 177 mammal species. We find that the rate of population loss in terrestrial vertebrates is extremely high-even in "species of low concern." In our sample, comprising nearly half of known vertebrate species, 32\% (8,851/27,600) are decreasing; that is, they have decreased in population size and range. In the 177 mammals for which we have detailed data, all have lost 30\% or more of their geographic ranges and more than 40\% of the species have experienced severe population declines ($>$80\% range shrinkage). Our data indicate that beyond global species extinctions Earth is experiencing a huge episode of population declines and extirpations, which will have negative cascading consequences on ecosystem functioning and services vital to sustaining civilization. We describe this as a "biological annihilation" to highlight the current magnitude of Earth's ongoing sixth major extinction event.},

The necessity of such work may not be evident to all, so at the outset I will sketch in broad outlines the state of affairs which led me to undertake the task. The fact is generally recognized that the wheats of this country are characterized by their high yields per acre and by the shapeliness of their grain. We can grow on the average over 30 bushels to the acre where the United States grow 14, Russia 10, and the Argentine 7. Yet the acreage under wheat in this country has fallen from three and a-half million acres in 1876 to one and a-half million in 1903, and we now grow approximately only one-fifth of the wheat we consume. Further than this there is good evidence to show that the quality of the grain now grown is inferior to that of twenty years ago. It has been sacrificed to yield, and many of the better class varieties, such as Chiddam, Red Lammas and Rough Chaff, have been more or less driven out of the field by varieties such as Square Head and Rivet, which are capable of giving slightly larger crops of grain and straw. These inferior varieties have now to compete with wheat imported from Canada, the United States, Russia and other countries. The seriousness of the position becomes evident when one finds English wheat selling at 28s. 6d. a quarter when Manitoba Hard is selling at 35s.},

R genes are presumed to (a) enable plants to detect Avr-gene-specified pathogen molecules, (b) initiate signal transduction to activate defenses, and (c) have the capacity to evolve new R gene specificities rapidly. Isolation of R genes has revealed four main classes of R gene sequences whose products appear to activate a similar range of defense mechanisms.

  abstract = {We review current ideas about coevolution of plants and parasites, particularly processes that generate genetic diversity. Frequencies of host resistance and parasite virulence alleles that interact in gene-for-gene (GFG) relationships coevolve in the familiar boom-and-bust cycle, in which resistance is selected when virulence is rare, and virulence is selected when resistance is common. The cycle can result in stable polymorphism when diverse ecological and epidemiological factors cause negative direct frequency-dependent selection (ndFDS) on host resistance, parasite virulence, or both, such that the benefit of a trait to fitness declines as its frequency increases. Polymorphism can also be stabilized by overdominance, when heterozygous hosts have greater resistance than homozygotes to diverse pathogens. Genetic diversity can also persist in the form of statistical polymorphism, sustained by random processes acting on gene frequencies and population size. Stable polymorphism allows alleles to be long-lived and genetic variation to be detectable in natural populations. In agriculture, many of the factors promoting stability in host-parasite interactions have been lost, leading to arms races of host defenses and parasite effectors.},

This paper provides an overview of the ecological status of agricultural systems across the European Union in the light of recent policy changes. It builds on the previous review of 2001 devoted to the impacts of agricultural intensification in Western Europe. The focus countries are the UK, The Netherlands, Boreal and Baltic countries, Portugal, Hungary and Romania, representing a geographical spread across Europe, but additional reference is made to other countries. Despite many adjustments to agricultural policy, intensification of production in some regions and concurrent abandonment in others remain the major threat to the ecology of agro-ecosystems impairing the state of soil, water and air and reducing biological diversity in agricultural landscapes. The impacts also extend to surrounding terrestrial and aquatic systems through water and aerial contamination and development of agricultural infrastructures (e.g. dams and irrigation channels). Improvements are also documented regionally, such as successful support of farmland species, and improved condition of watercourses and landscapes. This was attributed to agricultural policy targeted at the environment, improved environmental legislation, and new market opportunities. Research into ecosystem services associated with agriculture may provide further pressure to develop policy that is targeted at their continuous provisioning, fostering motivation of land managers to continue to protect and enhance them.

  abstract = {Hosts and their obligate pathogens exhibit intimate physiological interactions. How such interactions impact upon evolution of each partner varies depending on the time-scale of interest. This chapter reviews theoretical advances and available data on host and pathogen evolution with regard to both short term (coevolution) and long term (cospeciation and speciation following host shifts) dynamics, and then discusses the possible links between processes acting at these two time scales. The genetic basis of the physiological interactions between host and pathogens has been identified in some systems, showing that as few as a single locus in each species can determine the success or failure of infection. Such simple interacting mechanism of infection and disease resistance has triggered theoretical developments on how allele frequencies in one species should evolve in response to the allele frequencies in the other species. This reciprocal influence in the short term is referred to as "coevolution" (in its narrow sense). The concept states that each species, host or pathogen, acts as a selective pressure on its partner in a frequency-dependent manner. Two simple outcomes for host and pathogen allele frequencies have been suggested. The "arms race" model describes frequency dynamics where advantageous new variants go to fixation. The "trench warfare" model depicts allele frequencies oscillating dynamically in time, several host and pathogen alleles being maintained over the long term. In this chapter, we detail the theoretical bases underlying arms race and trench warfare dynamics, and review empirical data supporting the different types of models. We also discuss recent theoretical advances that an attempt to analyze more complex coevolutionary scenarios and integrate environmental effects into these simple models. Another field of research on hostpathogen evolution is devoted to elucidating whether the partners in such associations speciate in parallel, i.e. diversify by cospeciation, or by other processes such as host shifts. We outline the approaches to compare the divergence between two species or loci and present insight gained on the long-term evolution of host-parasite associations, whether pathogenic or not. Speciation in parasites seems to regularly occur without tracking host speciation, for instance after host shifts. We finally examine the relationship between coevolution and pathogen diversification. We summarize theoretical and experimental works showing that coevolution can foster pathogen specialization, but that more frequently these events are associated with host shifts and subsequent speciation, than with cospeciation. As a conclusion, in contrast to previous assumptions, we now have substantial evidences that coevolutionary dynamics of hosts and pathogens do not favor long-term cospeciation patterns, and that the idea that cospeciation prevails among host-parasite associations is invalid.},

It is characterized by reciprocal genetic change and thus changes in allele frequencies within populations. These are determined by three main types of selection dynamics: negative frequency-dependent selection when a rare allele has a selective advantage; overdominance caused by heterozygote advantage; and directional selective sweeps near an advantageous mutation.
Theories of host\textendash{}parasite coevolution include the geographic mosaic theory, which assumes a selection mosaic, coevolutionary hotspots, and geographic mixing; the Red Queen hypothesis, which proposes that parasitism favours sexual reproduction in the host; and an evolutionary trade-off between transmission and virulence, since if the parasite kills its host too quickly, the parasite will not be able to reproduce.
Model systems include the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans with the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis; the crustacean Daphnia and its numerous parasites; and Escherichia coli and the mammals (including humans) whose intestines it inhabits.},

Amongst other work, Van Valen's proposed "Law of Extinction", known as Van Valen's law, drew upon the apparent constant probability (as opposed to rate) of extinction in families of related organisms, based on data compiled from existing literature on the duration of tens of thousands of genera throughout the fossil record.  Van Valen proposed the Red Queen Hypothesis (1973), as an explanatory tangent to the Law of Extinction.  The Red Queen Hypothesis captures the idea that there is a constant 'arms race' between co-evolving species.  Its name is a reference to the Red Queen's race in Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking-Glass, in which the chess board moves such that Alice must continue running just to stay in the same place.Van Valen also defined the Ecological Species Concept in 1976, in contrast to Ernst Mayr's Biological Species Concept. In 1991, he proposed that HeLa cells be defined as a new species, which was named Helacyton gartleri.Van Valen originated the concept of fuzzy sets, prior to the formalization of this concept by L.A. Zadeh. He was the editor of the journal Evolutionary Theory, which he printed on simple paper stock under the motto, "Substance over form."
He had a deep understanding of many fields outside of biology, including measure theory, probability theory, logic, thermodynamics, epistemology and the philosophy of science. As a biologist, Van Valen considered the role of zoological and botanical gardens, in a world with a degrading  natural environment, to be essential for the safeguard of endangered flora and fauna.},

  abstract = {The fitness costs of disease resistance in plants are reviewed and their relevance to plant breeding is discussed. An important theme of current research is that plant defence is closely integrated into pathways that regulate growth and development in plants, so mutations in genes with central locations in defence networks often have numerous pleiotropic effects. There is increasing evidence that resistance to one disease involves trade-offs with responses to other bio-antagonists; the numerous pleiotropic effects of mlo resistance to powdery mildew of barley are discussed as an example. There is a striking contrast between the low costs of resistance in most crop diseases and the sometimes high costs of resistance in model systems studied in fundamental research. It is suggested that, through natural and artificial selection over thousands of years, farmers and more recently plant breeders have selected alleles which maximize the benefits and minimize the costs of resistance. There is sometimes substantial genotype-by-environment interaction in fitness costs, which makes experiments on fitness in plants especially challenging, but it is essential to understand these interactions to appreciate the relevance of fitness costs and trade-offs to crops in field conditions. It is proposed that in the great majority of cases, in which it is not feasible to investigate fitness costs and their interactions with the environment in depth, plant breeding is an efficient way of incorporating genes with benefits which exceed any costs into commercially successful cultivars of arable crops.},

  abstract = {Background: Genomic and pathology analysis has revealed enormous diversity in genes involved in disease, including those encoding host resistance and parasite effectors (also known in plant pathology as avirulence genes). It has been proposed that such variation may persist when an organism exists in a spatially structured metapopulation, following the geographic mosaic of coevolution. Here, we study gene-for-gene relationships governing the outcome of plant-parasite interactions in a spatially structured system and, in particular, investigate the population genetic processes which maintain balanced polymorphism in both species. Results: Following previous theory on the effect of heterogeneous environments on maintenance of polymorphism, we analysed a model with two demes in which the demes have different environments and are coupled by gene flow. Environmental variation is manifested by different coefficients of natural selection, the costs to the host of resistance and to the parasite of virulence, the cost to the host of being diseased and the cost to an avirulent parasite of unsuccessfully attacking a resistant host. We show that migration generates negative direct frequency-dependent selection, a condition for maintenance of stable polymorphism in each deme. Balanced polymorphism occurs preferentially if there is heterogeneity for costs of resistance and virulence alleles among populations and to a lesser extent if there is variation in the cost to the host of being diseased. We show that the four fitness costs control the natural frequency of oscillation of host resistance and parasite avirulence alleles. If demes have different costs, their frequencies of oscillation differ and when coupled by gene flow, there is amplitude death of the oscillations in each deme. Numerical simulations show that for a multiple deme island model, costs of resistance and virulence need not to be present in each deme for stable polymorphism to occur. Conclusions: Our theoretical results confirm the importance of empirical studies for measuring the environmental heterogeneity for genetic costs of resistance and virulence alleles. We suggest that such studies should be developed to investigate the generality of this mechanism for the long-term maintenance of genetic diversity at host and parasite genes.},

  abstract = {Variation in host resistance and in the ability of pathogens to infect and grow (i.e. pathogenicity) is important as it provides the raw material for antagonistic (co)evolution and therefore underlies risks of disease spread, disease evolution and host shifts. Moreover, the distribution of this variation in space and time may inform us about the mode of coevolutionary selection (arms race vs. fluctuating selection dynamics) and the relative roles of G \texttimes{} G interactions, gene flow, selection and genetic drift in shaping coevolutionary processes. Although variation in host resistance has recently been reviewed, little is known about overall patterns in the frequency and scale of variation in pathogenicity, particularly in natural systems. Using 48 studies from 30 distinct host\textendash{}pathogen systems, this review demonstrates that variation in pathogenicity is ubiquitous across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Quantitative analysis of a subset of extensively studied plant\textendash{}pathogen systems shows that the magnitude of within-population variation in pathogenicity is large relative to among-population variation and that the distribution of pathogenicity partly mirrors the distribution of host resistance. At least part of the variation in pathogenicity found at a given spatial scale is adaptive, as evidenced by studies that have examined local adaptation at scales ranging from single hosts through metapopulations to entire continents and \textendash{} to a lesser extent \textendash{} by comparisons of pathogenicity with neutral genetic variation. Together, these results support coevolutionary selection through fluctuating selection dynamics. We end by outlining several promising directions for future research.},

We use the Linum marginale-Melampsora lini plant-pathogen system and a hierarchical spatial structure to investigate patterns of local adaptation within a metapopulation characterised by epidemic dynamics and frequent extinction of pathogen populations. Based on large sample sizes and comprehensive cross-inoculation trials, our analyses demonstrate strong local adaptation by Melampsora to its host populations, with this effect being greatest at regional scales, as predicted from the broader spatial scales at which M. lini disperses relative to L. marginole. However, there was no consistent trend for more distant pathogen populations to perform more poorly. Our results further show how the coevolutionary interaction between hosts and pathogens can be influenced by local structure such that resistant hosts select for generally virulent pathogens, while susceptible hosts select for more avirulent pathogens. Empirically, local adaptation has generally been tested in two contrasting ways: (1) pathogen performance on sympatric versus allopatric hosts; and (2) sympatric versus allopatric pathogens on a given host population. In situations where no host population is more resistant or susceptible than others when averaged across pathogen populations (and likewise, no pathogen population is more virulent or avirulent than others), results from these tests should generally be congruent. We argue that this is unlikely to be the case in the metapopulation situations that predominate in natural host-pathogen interactions, thus requiring tests that control simultaneously for variation in plant and pathogen populations.},

Trade-offs in pathogens are of particular interest because they may constrain the evolution and epidemiology of diseases. Here, studies that have measured life-history trade-offs in pathogens (fungi, oomycetes and viruses) of agricultural crops, as well as pathogens attacking wild host plants, are reviewed. The majority of studies report a penalty associated with high virulence as is evidenced by lower performance during subsequent life-history stages. However, costs are not pervasive, and the strength and even shape of life-history correlations can vary according to host genotype, and abiotic environment. Importantly, life-history trade-offs are shown to have profound epidemiological implications ranging from lower disease prevalence of strains harbouring unnecessary virulence, to increased extinction risk at the metapopulation level. From an evolutionary perspective, costs of virulence are shown to constrain the range of R genes, and hence host genotypes, a given strain can adapt to. Moreover, costs of virulence play an important role in limiting the host range of pathogens.

  abstract = {Plant resistance (R) genes are a crucial component in plant defence against pathogens(1). Although R genes often fail to provide durable resistance in an agricultural context, they frequently persist as long-lived balanced polymorphisms in nature(2-4). Standard theory explains the maintenance of such polymorphisms through a balance of the costs and benefits of resistance and virulence in a tightly coevolving host-pathogen pair(5,6). However, many plant-pathogen interactions lack such specificity(7). Whether, and how, balanced polymorphisms are maintained in diffusely interacting species(8) is unknown. Here we identify a naturally interacting R gene and effector pair in Arabidopsis thaliana and its facultative plant pathogen, Pseudomonas syringae. The protein encoded by the R gene RPS5 recognizes an AvrPphB homologue (AvrPphB2) and exhibits a balanced polymorphism that has been maintained for over 2 million years (ref. 3). Consistent with the presence of an ancient balanced polymorphism, the R gene confers a benefit when plants are infected with P. syringae carrying avrPphB2 but also incurs a large cost in the absence of infection. RPS5 alleles are maintained at intermediate frequencies in populations globally, suggesting ubiquitous selection for resistance. However, the presence of P. syringae carrying avrPphB is probably insufficient to explain the RPS5 polymorphism. First, avrPphB homologues occur at very low frequencies in P. syringae populations on A. thaliana. Second, AvrPphB only rarely confers a virulence benefit to P. syringae on A. thaliana. Instead, we find evidence that selection for RPS5 involves multiple non-homologous effectors and multiple pathogen species. These results and an associated model suggest that the R gene polymorphism in A. thaliana may not be maintained through a tightly coupled interaction involving a single coevolved R gene and effector pair. More likely, the stable polymorphism is maintained through complex and diffuse community-wide interactions.},

High-throughput DNA sequencing coupled with new analytical approaches make it possible to differentiate among these mechanisms and to infer the time and place where pathogens first emerged. We present several examples to illustrate the different mechanisms and timescales associated with the origins of important plant pathogens. In some cases pathogens were domesticated along with their hosts during the invention of agriculture approximately 10,000 years ago. In other cases pathogens appear to have emerged very recently and almost instantaneously following horizontal gene transfer or hybridization. The predominant unifying feature in these examples is the environmental and genetic uniformity of the agricultural ecosystem in which the pathogens emerged. We conclude that agro-ecosystems will continue to select for new pathogens unless they are re-engineered to make them less conducive to pathogen emergence.},

Diversity is commonly observed at such loci and at corresponding loci encoding antigenic molecules in parasites. Multilocus theoretical models of host-parasite coevolution predict that polymorphism is more likely than in single-locus interactions because recurrent coevolutionary cycles are sustained by indirect frequency-dependent selection as rare genotypes have a selective advantage. These cycles are stabilized by direct frequency-dependent selection, resulting from repeated reinfection of the same host by a parasite, a feature of most diseases. Here, it is shown that for realistically small costs of resistance and virulence, polycyclic disease and high autoinfection rates, stable polymorphism of all possible genotypes is obtained in parasite populations. Two types of epistatic interactions between loci tend to increase the parameter space in which stable polymorphism can occur with all possible host and parasite genotypes. In the parasite, the marginal cost of each additional Virulence allele should increase, while in the host, the marginal cost of each additional resistance allele should decrease. It is therefore predicted that GFG polymorphism will be stable (and hence detectable) when there is partial complementation of avirulence genes in the parasite and of resistance genes in the host.},

In line with the idea of continuing host\textendash{}parasite coevolution, temporal variation in parasite infectivity changed little over time.

Then we discuss reciprocal transplant and common garden experiments designed to detect local adaptation in the pattern of deme x habitat interaction for fitness. Finally, we review research questions and approaches to studying the processes of local adaptation - divergent natural selection, dispersal and gene flow, and other processes affecting adaptive differentiation of local demes. We advocate multifaceted approaches to the study of local adaptation, and stress the need for experiments explicitly addressing hypotheses about the role of particular ecological and genetic factors that promote or hinder local adaptation. Experimental evolution of replicated populations in controlled spatially heterogeneous environments allow direct tests of such hypotheses, and thus would be a valuable way to complement research on natural populations.},

These activities, when supplemented with high resource inputs and the broad application of agrochemicals, create conditions uniquely conducive to widespread plant disease epidemics and rapid pathogen evolution. To be effective and durable, sustainable disease management requires a significant shift in emphasis to overtly include ecoevolutionary principles in the design of adaptive management programs aimed at minimizing the evolutionary potential of plant pathogens by reducing their genetic variation, stabilizing their evolutionary dynamics, and preventing dissemination of pathogen variants carrying new infectivity or resistance to agrochemicals.},

Infectious diseases provide some of the best-studied examples of the role of seasonality in shaping population fluctuations.

Empirical evidence points to several biologically distinct mechanisms by which seasonality can impact host-pathogen interactions, including seasonal changes in host social behaviour and contact rates, variation in encounters with infective stages in the environment, annual pulses of host births and deaths and changes in host immune defences. Mathematical models and field observations show that the strength and mechanisms of seasonality can alter the spread and persistence of infectious diseases, and that population-level responses can range from simple annual cycles to more complex multiyear fluctuations. From an applied perspective, understanding the timing and causes of seasonality offers important insights into how parasite-host systems operate, how and when parasite control measures should be applied, and how disease risks will respond to anthropogenic climate change and altered patterns of seasonality. Finally, by focusing on well-studied examples of infectious diseases, we hope to highlight general insights that are relevant to other ecological interactions.},

There is little knowledge on the use of crops to trap nematodes in protected cultivation systems. Therefore, we tested a resistant pepper as a trap crop for root-knot nematodes over 4 years in a commercial farm and an experimental station in Southern France. The effects of pepper trap crop on plant damages and soil infestation were compared with a sorghum cover crop. We also surveyed 28 local vegetable farmers for their interest concerning the possible use of the pepper trap crop. Our results show that nematode infestation of the soil decreased by 99 and 80\% after the first and second implementation of the trap crop. The gall index measured on Swiss chard decreased from 2.5 to less than 1 after 4 years. Respectively, 21 and 36 \% of farmers found the cropping system completely and partially acceptable. The most interested farmers were those having sufficient labor and available land in summer. Farmer criticisms were higher nursery costs and planting duration, versus sorghum. Overall, this is the first design of a cropping system using a resistant cultivar as a dead-end trap crop for root-knot nematodes. The process used, moving from a genetic construct to agronomic innovation through an interdisciplinary and participatory approach, holds promise for scientists seeking new integrated pest management approaches to increase the sustainability of agriculture.},

Research has been conducted to evaluate the durability of these R-genes, by comparing the reproduction of several laboratory-selected and wild virulent \emph{Meloidogyne} \emph{incognita} isolates, on both susceptible and resistant tomatoes and peppers. We first show that the Me1 R-gene in pepper behaves as a robust R-gene controlling avirulent and virulent Me3, Me7 or Mi-1 isolates. Although the reproductive potential of the virulent isolates was highly variable on susceptible and resistant plants, we also confirm that virulence is highly specific to a determined R-gene on which selection has occurred. Another significant experimental result is the observation that a reproductive fitness cost is associated with nematode virulence against Mi-1 in tomato and Me3 and Me7 in pepper. The adaptative significance of trade-offs between selected characters and fitness-related traits, suggests that, although the resistance can be broken, it may be preserved in some conditions if the virulent nematodes are counter-selected in susceptible plants. All these results have important consequences for the management of plant resistance in the field.},

  abstract = {The root-knot nematode (\emph{Meloidogyne} spp.) is a major plant pathogen, affecting several solanaceous crops worldwide. In Capsicum annuum, resistance to this pathogen is controlled by several independent dominant genes-the Me genes. Six Me genes have previously been shown to be stable at high temperature in three highly resistant and genetically distant accessions: PI 322719, PI 201234, and CM334 (Criollo de Morelos 334). Some genes (Me4, Mech1, and Mech2) are specific to certain \emph{Meloidogyne} species or populations, whereas others (Me1, Me3, and Me7) are effective against a wide range of \emph{Meloidogyne} species, including M. arenaria, M. javanica, and M. \emph{incognita}, the most common species in Mediterranean and tropical areas. These genes direct different response patterns in root cells depending on the pepper line and nematode species. Allelism tests and fine mapping using the BSA-AFLP approach showed these genes to be different but linked, with a recombination frequency of 0.02-0.18. Three of the PCR-based markers identified in several genetic backgrounds were common to the six Me genes. Comparative mapping with CarthaGene software indicated that these six genes clustered in a single genomic region within a 28 cM interval. Four markers were used to anchor this cluster on the P9 chromosome on an intraspecific reference map for peppers. Other disease resistance factors have earlier been mapped in the vicinity of this cluster. This genomic area is colinear to chromosome T12 of tomato and chromosome XII of potato. Four other nematode resistance genes have earlier been identified in this area, suggesting that these nematode resistance genes are located in orthologous genomic regions in Solanaceae.},

  abstract = {Capsicum annuum L. has resistance to root-knot nematodes (RKN) (Meloidogyne spp.), severe polyphagous pests that occur world-wide. Several single dominant genes confer this resistance. Some are highly specific, whereas others are effective against a wide range of species. The spectrum of resistance to eight clonal RKN populations of the major Meloidogyne species, M. arenaria (2 populations), M. incognita (2 populations), M. javanica (1 population), and M. hapla (3 populations) was studied using eight lines of Capsicum annuum. Host susceptibility was determined by counting the egg masses (EM) on the roots. Plants were classified into resistant (R; EM {$\leq$} 5) or susceptible (H; EM {$>$}5) classes. The french cultivar Doux Long des Landes was susceptible to all nematodes tested. The other seven pepper lines were highly resistant to M. arenaria, M. javanica and one population of M. hapla. Variability in resistance was observed for the other two populations of M. hapla. Only lines PM687, PM217, Criollo de Morelos 334 and Yolo NR were resistant to M. incognita. To investigate the genetic basis of resistance in the highly resistant line PM687, the resistance of two progenies was tested with the two populations of M. incognita: 118 doubled-haploid (DH) lines obtained by androgenesis from F(1) hybrids of the cross between PM687 and the susceptible cultivar Yolo Wonder, and 163 F(2) progenies. For both nematodes populations, the segregation patterns 69 R / 49 S for DH lines and 163 R / 45 S for F(2) progenies were obtained at 22\textdegree{}C and at high temperatures (32\textdegree{}C and 42\textdegree{}C). The presence of a single dominant gene that totally prevented multiplication of M. incognita was thus confirmed and its stability at high temperature was demonstrated. This study confirmed the value of C. annuum  as a source of complete spectrum resistance to the major RKN.},

Bulked-segregant analysis with DNA pools, from susceptible or resistant DH lines, was performed to identify RAPD and AFLP markers linked to Me3. There was no polymorphism between bulks of ten DH lines using over 800 RADP primers (4,000 amplified fragments analysed). Using 512 AFLP primers (74,000 amplified fragments analysed), and bulked DNA templates from 20 resistant and 20 susceptible plants, we identified eight repulsion-phase and four coupling-phase markers linked to Me3.Analysed in 103 DH progeny, they defined a 56.1-cM interval containing the target gene. The nearest were located 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 3.0 centimorgans (cM) on both sides of the gene. Analysis of the F2 progeny (162 plants) with the nearest coupling-phase marker confirmed its close position. Another resistance gene to RKN, present in 'PM687' (Me4), was shown to be linked to Me3, 10 cM from it. In order to localize Me3and Me4 on our reference intraspecific pepper linkage map, two AFLP markers were mapped. The Me3 nearest marker was 10.1cM from a RAPD marker named Q04\_0.3 and 2.7cM from a RFLP marker named CT135. We investigated map-position orthologies between Me3and two other nematode resistance genes, the tomato Mi-3 and the potato Gpa2genes, which mapped in the telomeric region of the short arm of the tomato and potato chromosome 12 (or XII for potato).},

  abstract = {The efficacy of disease resistance genes in plants decreases over time because of the selection of virulent pathogen genotypes. A key goal of crop protection programs is to increase the durability of the resistance conferred by these genes. The spatial and temporal deployment of plant disease resistance genes is considered to be a major factor determining their durability. In the literature, four principal strategies combining resistance genes over time and space have been considered to delay the evolution of virulent pathogen genotypes. We reviewed this literature with the aim of determining which deployment strategy results in the greatest durability of resistance genes. Although theoretical and empirical studies comparing deployment strategies of more than one resistance gene are very scarce, they suggest that the overall durability of disease resistance genes can be increased by combining their presence in the same plant (pyramiding). Retrospective analyses of field monitoring data also suggest that the pyramiding of disease resistance genes within a plant is the most durable strategy. By extension, we suggest that the combination of disease resistance genes with other practices for pathogen control (pesticides, farming practices) may be a relevant management strategy to slow down the evolution of virulent pathogen genotypes.},

The two groups of nematodes appear to have adopted radically different solutions to these problems with the result that one group is a host specialist and reproduces sexually while the other has an enormous host range and reproduces by mitotic parthenogenesis. We consider what is known about the modes of parasitism used by these nematodes and how it relates to their host range, including the surprising finding that parasitism genes in both nematode groups have been recruited from bacteria. The nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of these two nematode groups are very different and we consider how these findings relate to the biology of the organisms.},

Although the emphasis on integrated pest management over the past three decades has promoted strategies and tactics for nematode management, comprehensive studies on the related soil biology-ecology are relatively recent. Traditional management tactics include host resistance (where available), cultural tactics such as rotation with nonhosts, sanitation and avoidance, and destruction of residual crop roots, and the judicious use of nematicides. There have been advances in biological control of nematodes, but field-scale exploitation of this tactic remains to be realized. New technologies and resources are currently becoming central to the development of sustainable systems for nematode-pest-crop management: molecular diagnostics for nematode identification, genetic engineering for host resistance, and the elucidation and application of soil biology for general integrated cropping systems. The latter strategy includes the use of nematode-pest antagonistic cover crops, animal wastes, and limited tillage practices that favor growth-promoting rhizobacteria, earthworms, predatory mites, and other beneficial organisms while suppressing parasitic nematodes and other plant pathogens. Certain rhizobacteria may induce systemic host resistance to nematodes and, in some instances, to foliage pathogens. The systems focusing on soil biology hold great promise for sustainable crop-nematode management, but only a few research programs are currently involved in this labor-intensive endeavor.},

All cultural practices are known to directly or indirectly affect populations of soilborne pathogens and the severity of their resultant root diseases. Soil biology is a major component and contributes significantly to soil quality and productivity. The major activities of soil microbes include the decomposition of organic materials, mineralization of nutrients, nitrogen fixation, suppression of crop pests and protection of roots, but also parasitism and injury to plants. Thus, there is a great need to assure that the introduced soil management practices to improve soil quality will also result and maintain a healthy soil. The latter include the abundance and diversity of total soil microbes, high population of beneficial organisms and low population and/or activities of crop pests. Production of vegetables and other food crops is often significantly affected by several soilborne pathogens that require control. The incidence and severity of root diseases is an indirect assessment of soil health for specific commodity/soil use. In addition, understanding and selecting the appropriate cultural practices that limit or prevent damage of root diseases is essential for the long-term and sustainable management of soil quality and health. Case-study examples are presented to illustrate the impact of cover crops and their green manures on the density and damage of root-knot and lesion nematodes to vegetables; and also tillage, soil amendments, crop rotation, and cover crops on bean yield and root rot severity.

  abstract = {In evolutionary sense no resistance lasts forever. The durability of a resistance can be seen as a quantitative trait; resistances may range from not durable at all (ephemeral, or transient) to highly durable. Ephemeral resistance occurs against fungi and bacteria with a narrow host range, specialists. It is characterised by a hypersensitive reaction (HR), major gene inheritance and many resistance genes, which often occur in multiple allelic series and/or complex loci. These resistance genes (alleles) interact in a gene-for-gene way with avirulence genes (alleles) in the pathogen to give an incompatible reaction. The pathogen neutralises the effect of the resistance gene by a loss mutation in the corresponding avirulence allele. The incompatible reaction is not elicited any more and the pathogenicity is restored. The pathogens can afford the loss of many avirulences without loss of fitness. Durable resistance against specialised fungi and bacteria is often quantitative and based upon the additive effects of some to several genes, the resulting resistance being of another nature than the hypersensitive reaction. This quantitative resistance is present to nearly all pathogens at low to fair levels in most commercial cultivars. Durable resistance of a monogenic nature occurs too and is usually of a non-HR type. Resistance against fungi and bacteria with a wide host range, generalists, is usually quantitative and durable. Resistances against viruses are often fairly durable, even if these are based on monogenic, race-specific, HR resistances. The level of specialisation does not seem to be associated with the durability of resistance.},

In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that a fitness cost may be associated with nematode virulence, using the interaction between the parthenogenetic species \emph{Meloidogyne} \emph{incognita} and tomato as a model system. The reproductive parameters of near-isogenic lines of the nematode, selected for avirulence or virulence against the tomato Mi resistance gene, were analysed and combined into a reproductive index that was taken as a measure of fitness. The lower fitness of the virulent lines on the susceptible tomato cultivar showed for the first time that a measurable fitness cost is associated with unnecessary virulence in the nematode. Although parthenogenesis should theoretically lead to little genetic variability, such cost may impose a direct constraint on the coevolution between the plant and the nematode populations, and suggests an adaptive significance of trade-offs between selected characters and fitness-related traits. These results indicate that, although plant resistance can be broken, it might prove durable in some conditions if the virulent nematodes are counterselected in susceptible plants, which could have important consequences for the management of resistant cultivars in the field.},

  abstract = {The efficacy of disease resistance genes in plants decreases over time because of the selection of virulent pathogen genotypes. A key goal of crop protection programs is to increase the durability of the resistance conferred by these genes. The spatial and temporal deployment of plant disease resistance genes is considered to be a major factor determining their durability. In the literature, four principal strategies combining resistance genes over time and space have been considered to delay the evolution of virulent pathogen genotypes: cultivars mixture, rotation, landscape deployment, pyramiding. We reviewed this literature with the aim of determining which deployment strategy results in the greatest durability of resistance genes. Although theoretical and empirical studies comparing deployment strategies of more than one resistance gene are very scarce, they suggest that the overall durability of disease resistance genes can be increased by combining their presence in the same plant (pyramiding). Retrospective analyses of field monitoring data also suggest that the pyramiding of disease resistance genes within a plant is the most durable strategy. By extension, we suggest that the combination of disease resistance genes with other practices for pathogen control (pesticides, farming practices) may be a relevant management strategy to slow down the evolution of virulent pathogen genotypes.},

In field tests of the recombinants over 2 years, disease levels were lower in three of six doubly resistant lines than in backcross lines carrying a single resistance gene, which in turn were less diseased than either `Clipper' or recombinants that lacked the marked resistance genes. All resistant lines significantly outyielded `Clipper' but did not themselves differ significantly. Lines resistant to scald had significantly higher grain size and grain weight. Gains for malt yield of about 1 \% were detected in the higher disease environment. Resistance was not accompanied by any obvious ``cost'' in terms of yield or quality. Protection against scald is therefore a significant requirement for new malting barley cultivars in scald-prone areas.},

Yield losses of up to 84\% have been attributed to the disease. Development and deployment of resistant materials is the most feasible approach to managing the disease. The objective of this study was to estimate the number of pyramided Fusarium root rot resistance genes among the four resistant lines and determine their effectiveness in improving levels of resistance to Fusarium root rot in the susceptible bean cultivars. Crosses among four Fusarium root rot (Fusarium solani f.sp. phaseoli) resistant common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) were developed. They involved six inbred lines, MLB-48-89A (M48), MLB-49-89A (M49), G2333 (G2) and G685 (G6), and two susceptible cultivars, K20 and Kanyebwa, The resistant lines were used to develop a double cross (DC) population. The DC F1 and each resistant parent were crossed to each of the two susceptible cultivars to form five-parent and single crosses, respectively. Developed populations were subjected to Fusarium solani f. sp. phasoeli isolate-3 under screenhouse conditions. There were segregation ratios of 15:1 ($\chi$2 = 1.89, P = 0.17), 61:3 ($\chi$2 = 0.18, P = 0.67) and 249:7 ($\chi$2 = 1.74, P = 0.19) indicating that two, three and four genes independently condition resistance to F. solani in lines G2 x G6, M49 x M48 and (M49 x M48) x (G2 x G6). A good fit of only four genes in the double cross compared to two in the G2 x G6 , and three genes in the M49 x M48 cross suggests that at least one parent in the G2 x G6 cross have the same or closely linked genes as a parent in the M49 x M48 cross. The F1 means of the five-parent cross (FPC) involving either susceptible parent had lower disease scores, though not significantly (P $>$ 0.05), than the single-crosses from that parent. The F2 of both FPC showed less disease than the single-cross (SC) means (P $<$ 0.05) compared to the single-cross (SC) while the F2 of both FPC had a significant negative deviation (P $<$ 0.05). The F2 frequency distributions also showed that the FPC in both Kanyebwa and K20 populations had higher proportions of resistant plants than any of the single crosses in the respective populations. The superior performance of the FPC over the SC demonstrates that combining resistance genes form different FRR resistance sources can provide a stable source of resistance than using single sources of resistance.African Crop Science Journal, Vol. 20, Issue Supplement s1, pp. 1 - 13},

Similarly, populations in which genotypes with different pathogen resistance are mixed may have lower pathogen levels and thus higher productivity than genetically uniform populations. We used genetically modified (GM) wheat as a model system to test this prediction, because it allowed us to use genotypes that differed only in the trait pathogen resistance but were otherwise identical. We grew three such genotypes or lines in monocultures or two-line mixtures. Phenotypic measurements were taken at the level of individual plants and of entire plots (population level). We found that resistance to mildew increased with both GM richness (0, 1, or 2 Pm3 transgenes with different resistance specificities per plot) and GM concentration (0\%, 50\%, or 100\% of all plants in a plot with a Pm3 transgene). Plots with two transgenes had 34.6\% less mildew infection and as a consequence 7.3\% higher seed yield than plots with one transgene. We conclude that combining genetic modification with mixed cropping techniques could be a promising approach to increase sustainability and productivity in agricultural systems, as the fitness cost of stacking transgenes within individuals may thus be avoided.},

The OC genes were stacked into the potato genome by simultaneous co-transformation with both OCI and OCII genes or by sequential re-transformation of an OCI-expressing transgenic line with an OCII gene.

Both recombinant OCs, detected by immunoblot, were in an active conformation as shown by their strong papain inhibitory activity. Although no significant differences in CPB larval mortality were observed when larvae fed on OCI/OCII transformed or control potato foliage, expression of both OCI and OCII in potato plants caused a reduction in CPB adult body weight and in weight of foliage consumed, indicating an additive effect. Overall, these results show that pyramiding of the OCI and OCII genes could be an effective strategy for breeding cultivars exhibiting elevated levels of resistance to CPB.},

  abstract = {Abstract The green leafhopper, Nephotettix virescens (Distant) (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae), occasionally damages rice in Asia either directly, by feeding on the host phloem, or indirectly by transmitting tungro virus. We assessed the nature of resistance against the leafhopper in monogenic and pyramided near-isogenic rice lines containing the resistance genes Grh2 and Grh4. Only the pyramided line was resistant to leafhopper damage. Leafhopper nymphs and adults had high mortality and low weight gain when feeding on the pyramided line and adults laid few eggs. In contrast, although there was some minor resistance in 45-day-old plants that possessed either Grh2 or Grh4 genes, the monogenic lines were generally as susceptible to the leafhopper as the recurrent parent line Taichung65 (T65). Resistance in the pyramided line was stable as the plant aged and under high nitrogen, and affected each of five Philippine leafhopper populations equally. Furthermore, in a selection study, leafhoppers failed to adapt fully to the pyramided resistant line: nymph and adult survival did improve during the first five generations of selection and attained similar levels as on T65, but egg-laying failed to improve over 10 generations. Our preliminary results suggested that resistance was associated with physiological costs to the plants in some experiments. The results of this study demonstrate the success of pyramiding resistance genes through marker-assisted breeding, to achieve a strong and potentially durable resistance. We discuss the utility of gene pyramiding and the development of near-isogenic lines for leafhopper management.},

Here, we developed near-isogenic experimental lines representing all possible combinations of four QTL alleles from a durably resistant cultivar. These lines enabled us to evaluate the QTLs singly and in combination in a homogeneous genetic background. We present evidence that pyramiding QTL alleles, each controlling a different response to M. oryzae, confers strong, non-race-specific, environmentally stable resistance to blast disease. Our results suggest that this robust defence system provides durable resistance, thus avoiding an evolutionary ``arms race'' between a crop and its pathogen.},

  abstract = {Once deployed uniformly in the field, genetically controlled plant resistance is often quickly overcome by pathogens, resulting in dramatic losses. Several strategies have been proposed to constrain the evolutionary potential of pathogens and thus increase resistance durability. These strategies can be classified into four categories, depending on whether resistance sources are varied across time (rotations) or combined in space in the same cultivar (pyramiding), in different cultivars within a field (cultivar mixtures) or among fields (mosaics). Despite their potential to differentially affect both pathogen epidemiology and evolution, to date the four categories of deployment strategies have never been directly compared together within a single theoretical or experimental framework, with regard to efficiency (ability to reduce disease impact) and durability (ability to limit pathogen evolution and delay resistance breakdown). Here, we used a spatially explicit stochastic demogenetic model, implemented in the R package landsepi, to assess the epidemiological and evolutionary outcomes of these deployment strategies when two major resistance genes are present. We varied parameters related to pathogen evolutionary potential (mutation probability and associated fitness costs) and landscape organization (mostly the relative proportion of each cultivar in the landscape and levels of spatial or temporal aggregation). Our results, broadly focused on qualitative resistance to rust fungi of cereal crops, show that evolutionary and epidemiological control are not necessarily correlated and that no deployment strategy is universally optimal. Pyramiding two major genes offered the highest durability, but at high mutation probabilities, mosaics, mixtures and rotations can perform better in delaying the establishment of a universally infective superpathogen. All strategies offered the same short-term epidemiological control, whereas rotations provided the best long-term option, after all sources of resistance had broken down. This study also highlights the significant impact of landscape organization and pathogen evolutionary ability in considering the optimal design of a deployment strategy.},

In particular, many landscape-based strategies rely on the deployment of resistant and susceptible cultivars in an agricultural landscape as a mosaic. However, the design of such strategies is not easy as strategies targeting epidemiological or evolutionary outcomes may not be the same. Using a stochastic spatially explicit model, we studied the impact of landscape organization (as defined by the proportion of fields cultivated with a resistant cultivar and their spatial aggregation) and key pathogen life-history traits on three measures of disease control. Our results show that short-term epidemiological dynamics are optimized when landscapes are planted with a high proportion of the resistant cultivar in low aggregation. Importantly, the exact opposite situation is optimal for resistance durability. Finally, well-mixed landscapes (balanced proportions with low aggregation) are optimal for long-term evolutionary equilibrium (defined here as the level of long-term pathogen adaptation). This work offers a perspective on the potential for contrasting effects of landscape organization on different goals of disease management and highlights the role of pathogen life history.},

However, the major thrust of these genomic and molecular approaches is to enhance the identification of resistance genes, to increase their ease of manipulation through marker and gene editing technologies and to lock a range of resistance genes together in simply manipulable resistance gene cassettes. All these approaches essentially continue a strategy that assumes the ability to construct genetic-based resistance barriers that are insurmountable to target pathogens.

  abstract = {Few investigations on host diversification at the landscape scale to control plant disease in agricultural systems are available in the literature. At this scale, landscape connectivity measures how the landscape structure facilitates or impedes the disease spread among host patches. We developed a simulation model, giving a particular attention to the representation of the landscape structures, and we characterized the landscape connectivity by the proportion and the aggregation level of the host varieties, the ability for the pathogen to develop on each host and its ability to disperse. The pathogen dynamics was represented by a matrix population model designed for a generic air-borne foliar disease. This framework was used to establish a detailed assessment of the influence of each landscape connectivity variable on the pathogen population dynamics. When deploying a host with complete resistance to the pathogen along with a susceptible host, mixed landscapes were always found to be more efficient to hamper the disease spread. However, when using a quantitatively resistant host, aggregating the hosts in different regions could result in a better control of the pathogen spread, depending on the proportion and level of resistance of the resistant host and according to a source-sink dynamics between the two hosts. The ability of the pathogen to disperse did not change the results from a qualitative point of view. By accounting explicitly for the landscape features, our approach can be used to guide further data analysis or to evaluate the effectiveness of control strategies designed at the landscape scale.

We address this issue by studying the phenotypic evolution of a spatial metapopulation using an adaptive dynamics approach. The singular strategy is found to be the mean of the optimal phenotypes in each habitat with larger weights for habitats present in large and well connected patches. The presence of spatial clusters of habitats in the metapopulation is found to facilitate specialisation and to increase both the level of adaptation and the evolutionary speed of the population when dispersal is limited. By showing that spatial structures are crucial in determining the specialisation level and the evolutionary speed of a population, our results give insight into the influence of spatial heterogeneity on the niche breadth of species.},

Such genetic resistance is often rapidly overtaken due to selection in the pathogen population, resulting in an arms race between plant breeders and the pathogen population. Here we ask whether there are strategies that can prolong the useful life of plant resistance genes. In a modelling study we compare three basic strategies: gene pyramiding, sequential use, and simultaneous use, and combinations of these. We furthermore explore the effects of fraction of host area, fraction of resistant host and the threshold fraction of virulence in the pathogen population at which resistance is considered overtaken on the useful life of resistance genes. We found that pyramiding is not always the most durable solution. Model results indicate that the most durable deployment strategy depends on the threshold fraction at which resistance is considered overtaken. This threshold fraction will depend on the economic value of the crop, and whether damage is acceptable. Pyramiding is only the most durable solution if the threshold is low. Otherwise, simultaneous use of single-gene resistant varieties is the most durable solution. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Criteria for invasion and persistence are introduced, initially for simple models of epidemics, and then for models with greater biological realism. Some ways in which epidemiological models are used to identify optimal strategies for the control of disease are discussed. Particular attention is given to the spatial structure of host populations and to the role of chance events in determining invasion and persistence of plant pathogens. Finally, three brief case studies are used to illustrate the practical applications of epidemiological theory to understand invasion and persistence of plant pathogens. These comprise long-term predictions for the persistence and control of Dutch elm disease; identification of methods to manage the spread of rhizomania on sugar beet in the U.K. by matching the scale of control with the spatial and temporal scales of the disease; and analysis of evolutionary change in virus control to identify risks of inadvertent selection for damaging virus strains.},

This leads to a definition of the durability of resistance as the time from introduction of the cultivar to the time when the frequency of the virulence gene reaches a preset threshold. It is questionable whether this is the most appropriate way to measure durability. Here we use a simple epidemiological model to link population dynamics and population genetics to compare three measures of durability: (i) the expected time until invasion of the virulent genotype, by mutation or immigration, and subsequent establishment of a population (Tinvasion); (ii) the virulence frequency related measure of the time for the virulent genotype to take-over the pathogen population ( Ttake-over); and (iii) the additional yield, measured by the additional number of uninfected host growth days (Tadditional). Specifically, we show how the measures of durability are affected by deployment and epidemiological parameters. We use a combination of numerical solution and analytical approximation of a model for the population dynamics of avirulent and virulent genotypes of a pathogen growing in dynamically changing populations of resistant and susceptible cultivars. The three measures of durability are compared. Some consequences of the results for durable resistance in multilines and mixtures and the regional deployment of resistant cultivars are discussed.},

Despite the recognition of the importance of demographic and environmental stochasticity on the dynamics of an epidemic, their effects on the evolution of the pathogen and durability of resistance has not received attention. We formulated a stochastic epidemiological model, based on the Kramer-Moyal expansion of the Master Equation, to investigate how random fluctuations affect the dynamics of an epidemic and how these effects feed through to the evolution of the pathogen and durability of resistance. We focused on two hypotheses: firstly, a previous deterministic model has suggested that the effect of cropping ratio (the proportion of land area occupied by the resistant crop) on the durability of crop resistance is negligible. Increasing the cropping ratio increases the area of uninfected host, but the resistance is more rapidly broken; these two effects counteract each other. We tested the hypothesis that similar counteracting effects would occur when we take account of demographic stochasticity, but found that the durability does depend on the cropping ratio. Secondly, we tested whether a superimposed external source of stochasticity (for example due to environmental variation or to intermittent fungicide application) interacts with the intrinsic demographic fluctuations and how such interaction affects the durability of resistance. We show that in the pathosystem considered here, in general large stochastic fluctuations in epidemics enhance extinction of the pathogen. This is more likely to occur at large cropping ratios and for particular frequencies of the periodic external perturbation (stochastic resonance). The results suggest possible disease control practises by exploiting the natural sources of stochasticity.},

Random patterns can reduce both density and genetic diversity of the pathogen population and delay invasion promoted by sexual recombination. By contrast, patchy distributions diversify pathogen population and, hence, reduce the efficacy of resistance genes.

We modeled the genetic and epidemiological processes shaping the demogenetic dynamics of viruses under a multilocus gene-for-gene system, from the plant to landscape scales. The landscape consisted of many fields, was subject to seasonality, and of a reservoir hosting viruses year-round. Strategy performance depended principally on the fitness costs of adaptive mutations, epidemic intensity before resistance deployment and landscape connectivity. Mosaics were at least as good as pyramiding strategies in most production situations tested. Pyramiding strategies performed better only with slowly changing virus reservoir dynamics. Mosaics are more versatile than pyramiding strategies, and we found that deploying a mosaic of three to five resistance genes generally provided effective disease control, unless the epidemics were driven mostly by within-field infections. We considered the epidemiological and evolutionary mechanisms underlying the greater versatility of mosaics in our case study, with a view to providing breeders and growers with guidance as to the most appropriate deployment strategy.},

Two field experiments were established in tomato greenhouses and a third in a nethouse for growing Antirrhinums, all infested with M. javanica. Dried residues of wild rocket (WR) were incorporated into the soil and then it was solarized to moderate temperatures to partially effect the pathogen population. Root galling on the roots of the successive tomato crop was significantly reduced to different levels by WR, solarization or their combination, in two experiments. Solarization, alone or combined with WR amendment, significantly reduced root knot incidence in the roots of snapdragon, but suppression of root galling in the roots of snapdragon in the following crop was not evident. We further assessed the potential of various herb residues, incorporated in small plots, and solarization to induce soil suppressiveness against root-knot caused by M. javanica. Amending soil with residues of WR, tarragon, peppermint or sage induced soil suppressiveness to root knot even when M. javanica was introduced into the soil after the termination of the treatment, and reduced the galling index in subsequently grown tomato plants, compared with non-amended soil. Our findings further validate the potential role of OA and solarization in inducing soil suppressiveness, which contributes to sustainable management of soilborne pathogens. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Four management systems, one having continuous susceptible soybean, a second consisting of a 3-yr rotation with 2 yr of a nonhost crop followed by susceptible soybean, and two 4-yr rotations alternating a susceptible and resistant cultivar with nonhost crops, were investigated at nematode-infested and noninfested locations. One 4-yr rotation had full-season soybean while the other had double-crop soybean. Data included soybean seed yield, yield components, and cyst nematode egg density. Grain yields of full-season, SCN-susceptible 'Stafford' were similar in all rotations at each location. Nonhost crops reduced nematode densities from 4000 eggs 100 cm(-3) in continuously cropped SCN-susceptible plots to 1000 and 500 eggs 100 cm(-3) in 3- and 4-yr rotations, respectively. However, nematode numbers rapidly increased to more than 5000 eggs 100 cm(-3) by seasons end when susceptible soybean was grown. The SCN-susceptible cultivar produced 33\% less grain and pods than did the SCN-resistant cultivar, Manokin, at the infested location while the cultivars yielded similarly at the noninfested site. Full-season and double-cropped soybean reacted similarly to SCN. Crop rotation reduced cyst nematode numbers, but this benefit did not reduce yield losses on subsequent SCN-susceptible soybean as numbers rapidly climbed to damaging levels.},

The relationship between yield and initial eelworm densities over this range could be expressed equally well untransformed or transformed (using square root transformation for cyst counts and log. transformation for egg counts). Sigmoid curves could not often be fitted to the graphs of yield against log. egg count because densities large or small enough were not often encountered and small numbers cannot be estimated with sufficient accuracy. Assuming straight-line regressions of yield on untransformed eelworm densities certain generalizations can be made. The slopes vary somewhat, but on average losses are 1{$\cdot$}2 tons/acre per ten full cysts/100 g and 0{$\cdot$}85 tons/acre per twenty eggs/g. Linear regressions tend to be parallel over a large range of potential yields which means that yield loss is independent of potential yield. In five trials there was some evidence that the yield had reached a minimum varying between 5 and 10 tons/acre when eelworm populations were very dense. In two trials, estimates of maximum and minimum yield were obtained.

Recently, agricultural emissions of MBr were implicated as a potentially significant contributor to stratospheric ozone depletion. As a precautionary measure for global ozone protection, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has enforced federal legislation which mandates a complete phase-out of MBr use within the United States by 1 January 2001. Thus, new cost effective, environmentally compatible strategies for control of nematodes and other soilborne pests and pathogens must be developed and tested in a relatively short time to avoid significant losses in crop productivity. The extent to which certain agricultural industries that are now heavily reliant on MBr are affected will depend on the development of sustainable, integrated tactics to pest control, such as combinations of cultural, chemical, and biological tactics. New multidisciplinary research and extension programs must be developed to address and overcome major constraints and incompatibilities that have prevented such tactics from being widely adopted.},

  abstract = {Durable disease resistance is a key component of global food security, and combining resistance genes into ``pyramids'' is an important way to increase durability of resistance. The mechanisms by which pyramids impart durability are not well known. The traditional view of resistance pyramids considers the use of major resistance gene (R-gene) combinations deployed against pathogens that are primarily asexual. Interestingly, published examples of the successful use of pyramids in the traditional sense are rare. In contrast, most published descriptions of durable pyramids in practice are for cereal rusts, and tend to indicate an association between durability and cultivars combining major R-genes with incompletely expressed, adult plant resistance genes. Pyramids have been investigated experimentally for a diversity of pathogens, and many reduce disease levels below that of the single best gene. Resistance gene combinations have been identified through phenotypic reactions, molecular markers, and challenge against effector genes. As resistance genes do not express equally in all genetic backgrounds, however, a combination of genetic information and phenotypic analyses provide the ideal scenario for testing of putative pyramids. Not all resistance genes contribute equally to pyramids, and approaches have been suggested to identify the best genes and combinations of genes for inclusion. Combining multiple resistance genes into a single plant genotype quickly is a challenge that is being addressed through alternative breeding approaches, as well as through genomics tools such as resistance gene cassettes and gene editing. Experimental and modeling tests of pyramid durability are in their infancy, but have promise to help direct future studies of pyramids. Several areas for further work on resistance gene pyramids are suggested.},

  abstract = {Genetically-controlled plant resistance can reduce the damage caused by pathogens. However, pathogens have the ability to evolve and overcome such resistance. This often occurs quickly after resistance is deployed, resulting in significant crop losses and a continuing need to develop new resistant cultivars. To tackle this issue, several strategies have been proposed to constrain the evolution of pathogen populations and thus increase genetic resistance durability. These strategies mainly rely on varying different combinations of resistance sources across time (crop rotations) and space. The spatial scale of deployment can vary from multiple resistance sources occurring in a single cultivar (pyramiding), in different cultivars within the same field (cultivar mixtures) or in different fields (mosaics). However, experimental comparison of the efficiency (i.e. ability to reduce disease impact) and durability (i.e. ability to limit pathogen evolution and delay resistance breakdown) of landscape-scale deployment strategies presents major logistical challenges. Therefore, we developed a spatially explicit stochastic model able to assess the epidemiological and evolutionary outcomes of the four major deployment options described above, including both qualitative resistance (i.e. major genes) and quantitative resistance traits against several components of pathogen aggressiveness: infection rate, latent period duration, propagule production rate, and infectious period duration. This model, implemented in the R package landsepi, provides a new and useful tool to assess the performance of a wide range of deployment options, and helps investigate the effect of landscape, epidemiological and evolutionary parameters. This article describes the model and its parameterisation for rust diseases of cereal crops, caused by fungi of the genus Puccinia. To illustrate the model, we use it to assess the epidemiological and evolutionary potential of the combination of a major gene and different traits of quantitative resistance. The comparison of the four major deployment strategies described above will be the objective of future studies.},

Here, we argue that these advances provide major opportunities to deliberately design deployment strategies in cereals that can take advantage of the evolutionary pressures faced by target pathogens. Different combinations of genes deployed either within single host individuals or between different individuals within or among crops, can be used to reduce the size of pathogen populations and generate patterns of disruptive selection. This will simultaneously limit immediate epidemic development and reduce the probability of subsequent evolutionary change in the pathogen for broader infectivity or increased aggressiveness. The same general principles are relevant to the control of noncereal diseases, but the most efficacious controls will vary reflecting the range of genetic options available and their fit with specific ecology and life-history combinations.},

In this study we developed a stochastic and discrete time simulation model to specifically examine the joint effects of host and pathogen dispersal on the evolution of pathogen specialisation in a spatially explicit metapopulation. We consider a plant-pathogen system in which the host metapopulation is composed of two plant genotypes. The pathogen is dispersed by air-borne spores on the host metapopulation. The pathogen population is characterised by a single life-history trait under selection, the infection efficacy. We found that restricted host dispersal can lead to high amount of pathogen diversity and that the extent of pathogen specialisation varied according to the spatial scale of host-pathogen dispersal. We also discuss the role of population asynchrony in determining pathogen evolutionary outcomes.},

In each species, fitness consequences of between-species interactions are controlled by a single haploid diallelic locus.

We show that under spatially homogeneous selection the maintenance of genetic variation is possible through asynchronous nonlinear dynamics where the allele frequencies in a majority of demes quickly synchronize but the rest do not. Spatially heterogeneous selection can maintain genetic variation even if migration rates are maximal. This happens in an oscillatory way. Genetic variation is most likely to be maintained at high levels if the heterogeneity in selection is large. If there are some restrictions on migration, genetic variation can be maintained at a stable equilibrium. This behavior is most likely at intermediate migration rates. In this case, the system can exhibit high spatial subdivision as measured by FST values but relatively low local adaptation.},

The gene-for-gene (GFG) system is a well-characterized genetic interaction of host recognition and parasite antigenic loci for a wide range of plant-parasite interactions. Long-term maintenance of polymorphism in GFG systems has remained puzzling for both theoreticians and empiricists. Traditionally this diversity has been explained by tradeoffs with other life-history traits closely linked with fitness, yet empirical evidence for such costs has remained mixed. Here we argue that incorporating simple ecological reality \textendash{} spatial structuring and gradient of environmental conditions \textendash{} into host\textendash{}parasite research will help us understand how polymorphism is maintained. While environmental conditions (biotic and abiotic factors) have been studied in depth in plant pathology for their influence on disease severity and plant yield, they have been rarely set into an evolutionary framework. We briefly review recent data on natural plant\textendash{}parasite metapopulations and theoretical models moving from single population models towards metapopulation theory to reveal in just how many ways spatial structuring may affect the coevolutionary process. We clarify also how spatially heterogeneous selection, through G\texttimes{}E (or G\texttimes{}G\texttimes{}E) interactions, may be particularly important for natural host\textendash{}parasite interactions and suggest that this provides the unifying ground upon which future theoretical and empirical work should be build on.},

A strong growth in use of ABC, particularly of microbial agents, is taking place in Latin America, followed by Asia. The current popularity of ABC is due to (1) its inherent positive characteristics (healthier for farm workers and persons living in farming communities, no harvesting interval or waiting period after release of agents, sustainable as there is no development of resistance against arthropod natural enemies, no phytotoxic damage to plants, better yields and a healthier product, reduced pesticide residues [well below the legal Maximum Residue Levels (MRLs)], (2) professionalism of the biological control industry (inexpensive large scale mass production, proper quality control, efficient packaging, distribution and release methods, and availability of many ($>$440 species) control agents for numerous pests), (3) a number of recent successes showing how biological control can save agricultural production when pesticides fail or are not available, (4) several non-governmental organizations (NGOs), consumers, and retailers demanding pesticide residues far below the legal MRLs, and (5) policy developments in several regions of the world aimed at reduction and replacement of synthetic pesticides by more sustainable methods of pest management. We are convinced, however, that ABC can be applied on a much larger area than it is today. We plead in the short term for a pragmatic form of agriculture that is adaptable, non-dogmatic and combines the sustainability gain from all types of agriculture and pest management methods.

Damage by RKN was shown to be density dependent, to increase with increasing duration of plant growth, and to be much greater for good than poor hosts. PCN populations both increase and decline more slowly than those of RKN, and modelling suggested that, when non-hosts are grown, differences in decline rates will have an accumulative effect on the effectiveness of rotation. Similarly, differences in nematicide effectiveness will have a major effect on post-harvest PCN populations, and nematicides were shown to be most effective when PCN populations are small.

  abstract = {Plant root exudates affect root-knot nematodes egg hatch. Chemicals in root exudates can attract nematodes to the roots or result in repellence, motility inhibition or even death. However, until recently little was known about the relationship between tomato root exudates chemicals and root-knot nematodes. In this study, root exudates were extracted from three tomato rootstocks with varying levels of nematode resistance: Baliya (highly resistant, HR), RS2 (moderately resistant, MR) and L-402 (highly susceptible, T). The effects of the root exudates on \emph{Meloidogyne} \emph{incognita} (M. \emph{incognita}) egg hatch, survival and chemotaxis of second-stage juveniles (J2) were explored. The composition of the root exudates was analysed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) prior to and following M. \emph{incognita} inoculation. Four compounds in root exudates were selected for further analysis and their allopathic effect on M. \emph{incognita} were investigated. Root exudates from each tomato rootstocks (HR, MR and T strains) suppressed M. \emph{incognita} egg hatch and increased J2 mortality, with the highest rate being observed in the exudates from the HR plants. Exudate from HR variety also repelled M. \emph{incognita} J2 while that of the susceptible plant, T, was demonstrated to be attractive. The relative amount of esters and phenol compounds in root exudates from HR and MR tomato rootstocks increased notably after inoculation. Four compounds, 2,6-Di-tert-butyl-p-cresol, L-ascorbyl 2,6-dipalmitate, dibutyl phthalate and dimethyl phthalate increased significantly after inoculation. The egg hatch of M. \emph{incognita} was suppressed by each of the compound. L-ascorbyl 2,6-dipalmitate showed the most notable effect in a concentration-dependent manner. All four compounds were associated with increased J2 mortality. The greatest effect was observed with dimethyl phthalate at 2 mmol.L-1. Dibutyl phthalate was the only compound observed to repel M. \emph{incognita} J2 with no effect being detected in the other compounds. Each of the four compounds were correlated with a reduction in disease index in the susceptible cultivar, T, and tomato seedlings irrigated with L-ascorbyl 2,6-dipalmitate at 2 mmol.L-1 showed the best resistance to M. \emph{incognita}. Taken together, this study provided a valuable contribution to understanding the underlying mechanism of nematode resistance in tomato cultivars.},

We use the Linum marginale\textemdash{}Melampsora lini plant-pathogen system and a hierarchical spatial structure to investigate patterns of local adaptation within a metapopulation characterised by epidemic dynamics and frequent extinction of pathogen populations. Based on large sample sizes and comprehensive cross-inoculation trials, our analyses demonstrate strong local adaptation by Melampsora to its host populations, with this effect being greatest at regional scales, as predicted from the broader spatial scales at which M. lini disperses relative to L. marginale. However, there was no consistent trend for more distant pathogen populations to perform more poorly. Our results further show how the coevolutionary interaction between hosts and pathogens can be influenced by local structure such that resistant hosts select for generally virulent pathogens, while susceptible hosts select for more avirulent pathogens. Empirically, local adaptation has generally been tested in two contrasting ways: (1) pathogen performance on sympatric versus allopatric hosts; and (2) sympatric versus allopatric pathogens on a given host population. In situations where no host population is more resistant or susceptible than others when averaged across pathogen populations (and likewise, no pathogen population is more virulent or avirulent than others), results from these tests should generally be congruent. We argue that this is unlikely to be the case in the metapopulation situations that predominate in natural host-pathogen interactions, thus requiring tests that control simultaneously for variation in plant and pathogen populations.},

Unfortunately, we are usually limited in our ability to investigate the numerical dynamics of natural populations across large spatial scales and over long periods of time. Here we combine mechanistic and statistical approaches to reconstruct continuous-time infection dynamics of an obligate fungal pathogen on the basis of discrete-time occurrence data. The pathogen, Podosphaera plantaginis, infects its host plant, Plantago lanceolata, in a metapopulation setting where the presence of the pathogen has been recorded annually for 6 years in $\sim$4,000 host populations across an area of 50 km \texttimes{} 70 km in Finland. The dynamics are driven by strong seasonality, with a high extinction rate during winter and epidemic expansion in summer for local pathogen populations. We are able to identify with our model the regions in the study area where overwintering has been most successful. These overwintering sites represent foci that initiate local epidemics during the growing season. There is striking heterogeneity at the regional scale in both the overwintering success of the pathogen and the encounter intensity between the host and the pathogen. Such heterogeneity has profound implications for the coevolutionary dynamics of the interaction.},

  abstract = {This review briefly addresses what has been learned about resistance durability in recent years, as well as the questions that still remain. Molecular analyses of major gene interactions have potential to contribute to both breeding for resistance and improved understanding of virulence impacts on pathogen fitness. Though the molecular basis of quantitative resistance is less clear, substantial evidence has accumulated for the relative simplicity of inheritance. There is increasing evidence for specific interactions with quantitative resistance, though implications of this for durability are still unknown. Mechanisms by which resistance gene pyramids contribute to durability remain elusive, though ideas have been generated for identifying gene combinations that may be more durable. Though cultivar mixtures and related approaches have been used successfully, identifying the diseases and conditions that are most conducive to the use of diversity has been surprisingly difficult, and the selective influence of diversity on pathogen populations is complex. The importance of considering resistance durability in a landscape context has received increasing emphasis and is an important future area of research. Experimental systems are being developed to test resistance gene deployment strategies that previously could be addressed only with logic and observation. The value of molecular markers for identifying and pyramiding major genes is quite clear, but the successful use of quantitative trait loci (QTL) for marker-assisted selection of quantitative resistance will depend greatly on the degree to which the identified QTL are expressed in different genetic backgrounds. Transgenic approaches will likely provide opportunities for control of some recalcitrant pathogens, though issues of durability for transgenes are likely to be no different than other genes for resistance. The need for high quality phenotypic analysis and screening methodologies is a priority, and field-based studies are likely to remain of signal importance in the foreseeable future.},

Clear evidence of the existence of SS, no redundant virulence genes, was not found. On the contrary, several crop pathosystems exist with several to many unnecessary virulence genes. Therefore, it is concluded that:1) SS as a general phenomenon does not exist in crop pathosystems: it is an empty concept. 2) It is not to be ruled out that SS operates in some crop pathosystems with respect to some VR-genes. 3) The complete adaptation of the pathogen population to a newly introduced VR gene is thought as a two-stage process consisting of the acquisition of the matching virulence gene followed by a recovery in general fitness. In many studies SS was thought to operate because the fitness of a race was measured before this second stage had been completed. 4) Contrary to crop pathosystems SS is assumed to operate in wild plant-biotrophic pathogen systems.},

Many R-gene loci are present in plant genomes, presumably reflecting the need to maintain a large repertoire of resistance alleles. These loci also often segregate for resistance and susceptibility alleles that natural selection has maintained as polymorphisms within a species for millions of years(1-5). Given the obvious advantage to an individual of being disease resistant, what prevents these resistance alleles from being driven to fixation by natural selection? A cost of resistance(6) is one potential explanation; most models require a lower fitness of resistant individuals in the absence of pathogens for long-term persistence of susceptibility alleles(7). Here we test for the presence of a cost of resistance at the RPM1 locus of Arabidopsis thaliana. Results of a field experiment comparing the fitness of isogenic strains that differ in the presence or absence of RPM1 and its natural promoter reveal a large cost of RPM1, providing the first evidence that costs contribute to the maintenance of an ancient R-gene polymorphism.},

It is shown that variation in the gene-for-gene system can be maintained at a noticeable level without assuming cost of resistance or cost of virulence, if the probability of extinction depends on the host mean fitness in the subpopulation. The level of variation in the pathogen population increases with increasing extinction rate, genetic drift and fitness of the infected host, but decreases with increasing migration rate. Generally, these effects are magnified for life cycles in which selection occur before genetic drift and after migration.

  abstract = {The fitness costs of disease resistance in plants are reviewed and their relevance to plant breeding is discussed. An important theme of current research is that plant defence is closely integrated into pathways that regulate growth and development in plants, so mutations in genes with central locations in defence networks often have numerous pleiotropic effects. There is increasing evidence that resistance to one disease involves trade-offs with responses to other bio-antagonists; the numerous pleiotropic effects of mlo resistance to powdery mildew of barley are discussed as an example. There is a striking contrast between the low costs of resistance in most crop diseases and the sometimes high costs of resistance in model systems studied in fundamental research. It is suggested that, through natural and artificial selection over thousands of years, farmers and more recently plant breeders have selected alleles which maximize the benefits and minimize the costs of resistance. There is sometimes substantial genotype-by-environment interaction in fitness costs, which makes experiments on fitness in plants especially challenging, but it is essential to understand these interactions to appreciate the relevance of fitness costs and trade-offs to crops in field conditions. It is proposed that in the great majority of cases, in which it is not feasible to investigate fitness costs and their interactions with the environment in depth, plant breeding is an efficient way of incorporating genes with benefits which exceed any costs into commercially successful cultivars of arable crops.},

The magnitude of this cost is the main biological parameter that influences the rate of development of resistance, the stability of the resistance and the rate at which the resistance might decrease if antibiotic use were reduced. These findings suggest that the fitness costs of resistance will allow susceptible bacteria to outcompete resistant bacteria if the selective pressure from antibiotics is reduced. Unfortunately, the available data suggest that the rate of reversibility will be slow at the community level. Here, we review the factors that influence the fitness costs of antibiotic resistance, the ways by which bacteria can reduce these costs and the possibility of exploiting them.},

Discussion 761 X. Conclusion 762 Acknowledgements 763 References 763 Summary Predictions based on evolutionary theory suggest that the adaptive value of evolved herbicide resistance alleles may be compromised by the existence of fitness costs. There have been many studies quantifying the fitness costs associated with novel herbicide resistance alleles, reflecting the importance of fitness costs in determining the evolutionary dynamics of resistance. However, many of these studies have incorrectly defined resistance or used inappropriate plant material and methods to measure fitness. This review has two major objectives. First, to propose a methodological framework that establishes experimental criteria to unequivocally evaluate fitness costs. Second, to present a comprehensive analysis of the literature on fitness costs associated with herbicide resistance alleles. This analysis reveals unquestionable evidence that some herbicide resistance alleles are associated with pleiotropic effects that result in plant fitness costs. Observed costs are evident from herbicide resistance-endowing amino acid substitutions in proteins involved in amino acid, fatty acid, auxin and cellulose biosynthesis, as well as enzymes involved in herbicide metabolism. However, these resistance fitness costs are not universal and their expression depends on particular plant alleles and mutations. The findings of this review are discussed within the context of the plant defence trade-off theory and herbicide resistance evolution.},

  abstract = {Plant resistance (R) genes are a crucial component in plant defence against pathogens(1). Although R genes often fail to provide durable resistance in an agricultural context, they frequently persist as long-lived balanced polymorphisms in nature(2-4). Standard theory explains the maintenance of such polymorphisms through a balance of the costs and benefits of resistance and virulence in a tightly coevolving host-pathogen pair(5,6). However, many plant-pathogen interactions lack such specificity(7). Whether, and how, balanced polymorphisms are maintained in diffusely interacting species(8) is unknown. Here we identify a naturally interacting R gene and effector pair in Arabidopsis thaliana and its facultative plant pathogen, Pseudomonas syringae. The protein encoded by the R gene RPS5 recognizes an AvrPphB homologue (AvrPphB2) and exhibits a balanced polymorphism that has been maintained for over 2 million years (ref. 3). Consistent with the presence of an ancient balanced polymorphism, the R gene confers a benefit when plants are infected with P. syringae carrying avrPphB2 but also incurs a large cost in the absence of infection. RPS5 alleles are maintained at intermediate frequencies in populations globally, suggesting ubiquitous selection for resistance. However, the presence of P. syringae carrying avrPphB is probably insufficient to explain the RPS5 polymorphism. First, avrPphB homologues occur at very low frequencies in P. syringae populations on A. thaliana. Second, AvrPphB only rarely confers a virulence benefit to P. syringae on A. thaliana. Instead, we find evidence that selection for RPS5 involves multiple non-homologous effectors and multiple pathogen species. These results and an associated model suggest that the R gene polymorphism in A. thaliana may not be maintained through a tightly coupled interaction involving a single coevolved R gene and effector pair. More likely, the stable polymorphism is maintained through complex and diffuse community-wide interactions.},

However, plant populations show considerable polymorphism at R -gene loci involved in pathogen recognition2. Here we have tested the arms-race model in Arabidopsis thaliana by analysing sequences flanking Rpm1, a gene conferring the ability to recognize Pseudomonas pathogens carrying AvrRpm1 orAvrB (ref. 3). We reject the arms-race hypothesis: resistance andsusceptibility alleles at this locus have co-existed for millions of years. To account for the age of alleles and the relative levels ofpolymorphism within allelic classes, we use coalescence theory to model the long-term accumulation of nucleotide polymorphism in the context of the short-term ecological dynamics of disease resistance. This analysis supports a `trench warfare' hypothesis, inwhich advances and retreats of resistance-allele frequency maintain variation for disease resistance as a dynamic polymorphism4,5.},

However, the complete picture is much more complex since the viral populations constantly evolve and adapt to their new hosts and vectors. This chapter puts emergence of plant viruses into the framework of evolutionary ecology, genetics, and epidemiology. We will stress that viral emergence begins with the stochastic transmission of preexisting genetic variants from the reservoir to the new host, whose fate depends on their fitness on each hosts, followed by adaptation to new hosts or vectors, and finalizes with an efficient epidemiological spread.},

  abstract = {Prediction of pathogen emergence is an important field of research, both in human health and in agronomy. Most studies of pathogen emergence have focused on the ecological or anthropic factors involved rather than on the role of intrinsic pathogen properties. The capacity of pathogens to infect a large set of host species, i.e. to possess a large host range breadth (HRB), is tightly linked to their emergence propensity. Using an extensive plant virus database, we found that four traits related to virus genome or transmission properties were strongly and robustly linked to virus HRB. Broader host ranges were observed for viruses with single-stranded genomes, those with three genome segments and nematode-transmitted viruses. Also, two contrasted groups of seed-transmitted viruses were evidenced. Those with a single-stranded genome had larger HRB than non-seed-transmitted viruses, whereas those with a double-stranded genome (almost exclusively RNA) had an extremely small HRB. From the plant side, the family taxonomic rank appeared as a critical threshold for virus host range, with a highly significant increase in barriers to infection between plant families. Accordingly, the plant\textendash{}virus infectivity matrix shows a dual structure pattern: a modular pattern mainly due to viruses specialized to infect plants of a given family and a nested pattern due to generalist viruses. These results contribute to a better prediction of virus host jumps and emergence risks.},

Theory predicts that different selection pressures in different hosts will result in fitness trade-offs across hosts, leading to specialization. This paper reviews the evidence in support of this prediction. A large fraction of plant viruses are multihost parasites: evidence for across-species trade-offs has been reported both from the analysis of field virus populations and, more often, from passage experiments resulting in host adaptation. More abundant evidence for across-host trade-offs derives from the analysis of the performance of resistance-breaking virus genotypes in resistant and susceptible host genotypes. Data indicate that overcoming dominant resistance is coupled to severe fitness costs, while overcoming recessive resistance may be associated with fitness costs according to the specific virus genotype. There is ample evidence that antagonistic pleiotropy is a major cause of the reported across-host trade-offs.},

In general, nematode-susceptible crops that followed effective rotation crops produced yields and supported nematode numbers similar to those obtained on crops treated with most standard nematicides. Fumigation with methyl bromide was an exception, and resulted in low nematode numbers up to the end of the susceptible target crop, whereas nematode numbers recovered following rotation crops. Performance of rotation crops was similar to clean fallow in most studies, and there was little evidence that rotation crops could suppress nematode numbers below levels obtained after clean fallow. Large reductions in nematode numbers often were achieved following rotation crops. In sites with relatively low initial population levels before rotation crops were used, effective rotation crops sometimes maintained relatively low nematode numbers through the following susceptible target crop, and nematode recovery was not observed until the second year of the rotation sequences. Where practical, very long rotations such as bahiagrass pastures were often effective in preventing increase in nematode numbers on subsequent susceptible crops. Rehabilitation of heavily infested sites is difficult, could require several years of rotation crops, and the benefit gained may last only through one susceptible crop.},

The syncytium is the only source of nutrients for developing parasites and functions only for the nematode's benefit. Its development begins from a single cell selected by the infective second stage juvenile. The selected initial syncytial cell and neighbouring cells undergo a sequence of changes leading to the rearrangement of their protoplasts. They become hypertrophied and some parts of their walls partially dissolve forming local cell wall openings. Several tens of stimulated plant cells undergo this process leading to the formation of a single confluent and multinuclear protoplast (syncytium). The syncytium's metabolism is controlled by the nematode. Typical cytological features of a syncytium include a decrease in vacuole volume, proliferation of the amount of cytoplasm and number of its organelles and hypertrophy of syncytial nuclei and nucleoli. Resistant plants can also be parasitized by infective juveniles of cyst nematodes, but the resistance responses evoked by nematode stimulation lead to the formation of syncytia that are unable to provide the amount of nutrients necessary for the development of females of the parasite. Thus mostly males develop on resistant plants.},

  abstract = {Plant-parasitic nematodes are pests of agricultural crops and cause considerable economic loss and, especially in developing countries, adverse social impact. They exhibit a variety of parasitic modes, with the endoparasitic cyst and root-knot nematodes attracting the most research interest. As a group, plant-parasitic nematodes display a variety of adaptations to the parasitic lifestyle and some species show remarkable abilities to survive and disperse in the absence of a host. The urgent need to find environmentally acceptable methods of control has provided the impetus for molecular studies to increase understanding of plant-nematode interactions. The burgeoning interest in comparative genomics will be a vital component in understanding the parasitic life style and identifying novel targets for control options. This introductory chapter provides background information about the life-cycle biology of plant-parasitic nematodes, their different feeding strategies and aspects of the host-parasitic interactions.},

  abstract = {Evidence from as early as the 1950's that phytoparasitic nematodes could secrete enzymes to facilitate penetration of the stylet through the host cell wall or to promote nematode migration within plant tissues was confirmed in 1998 with the report of the first genes encoding endogenous endo-1,4-$\beta$-glucanases isolated from animals, the phytoparasitic cyst nematodes. Expressed gene analyses and recent genome sequencing efforts have since identified genes encoding cellulases, hemicellulases, pectinases, and chitinases in many species of phytoparasitic nematodes. A cellulose-binding module present in some nematode endoglucanases also exists independently of the hydrolytic domain in some species and has promoted the discovery of the first expansins outside of the plant kingdom. Database homologies and phylogenetic analyses suggest the potential for independent ancient horizontal gene transfer events of genes encoding a number of nematode cell wall-modifying proteins from microbes present in the nematode's ecological niche, including soil bacterial sources for root-feeding nematodes and fungal sources for shoot and fungal-feeding nematodes. Subsequent gene duplication and domain shuffling activity has apparently led to the evolutionary expansion of families of genes encoding cell wall-modifying proteins within nematode genomes. In almost all cases, expression of these cell wall-modifying proteins is restricted to the nematode oesophageal gland cells for secretion from the stylet during the migratory stages of the nematode parasitic cycle.},

A number of specific adaptations are found, especially in short-distance transport in feeding cells of sedentary nematodes. They include wall modifications, facilitated water transport, and active solute transport via transport proteins along the apoplast as well as symplasmic transport via plasmodesmata. Feeding cells are unique in that they combine opposing phenomena at the same time: on the one hand a strong sink is generated by high metabolic activity and accumulation of solutes. On the other hand large amounts of water and solutes are withdrawn by the nematodes from the feeding cells without reducing their viability and productiveness. Finally, knowledge on the nature of nutrients and nematode adaptations to limited nutrient supply is presented.},

High-throughput transcriptome profiling has facilitated the identification of an increasing number of novel hormone related genes that are differentially expressed during feeding cell development.

Here, we present a comprehensive overview of the role of classical plant hormones, including cytokinin, auxin and ethylene, in the establishment of nematode-induced regulatory networks upon infection of plant roots.

The mechanisms used by plant nematodes to protect themselves from direct attack by their hosts are relatively well characterised and show many parallels to the systems employed by animal parasitic nematodes to protect themselves from the immune responses of their hosts. In both cases housekeeping antioxidant proteins become changed in their expression patterns so that they are present at the host-parasite interface where they can detoxify host derived active oxygen species in a fine example of convergent evolution. However, the systems by which plant nematodes protect their biotrophic feeding structures are less well characterised.

  abstract = {Cell cycle activation is a key component of host plant manipulation by sedentary nematodes. It is generally believed that root-knot nematodes induce giant cells by repeated cycles of acytokinetic mitosis accompanied by endocycles while cyst nematodes induce extra rounds of DNA synthesis. Microscopic expression analysis of genes that encode key regulators of the cell cycle and the use of cell cycle inhibitors demonstrate that endoreduplication cycles may play a role in both giant cell and syncytium formation, while mitosis is essential for giant cell development and syncytium expansion (via fusion of neighbouring cells). When mitosis is blocked, gall development is completely inhibited, indicating that cycles of endoreduplication or other means of DNA amplification are insufficient to drive giant cell expansion. DNA synthesis is required for both gall and syncytium development.With the current knowledge available on the plant cell cycle, and particularly the genes involved in endoreduplication, their specific role in feeding site development can be determined more precisely to provide insight on how cell cycle processes underlie development of both giant cells and syncytia. It is still unknown whether signals from the nematode directly induce the sophisticated changes in the cell cycle that occur in developing feeding sites. Increasing knowledge on nematode secreted proteins active during parasitism will facilitate the identification of possible triggers of the plant cell cycle during this complex plant-pathogen interaction.},

Comparative analysis of these two RKN genomes reveals striking differences in their organizations and sheds light on the mechanisms and evolution of parasitism. The M. hapla genome with 54 Mbp and 14,454 genes represents the smallest metazoan genome characterized so far. By contrast, the organization of the M. \emph{incognita} genome with 86 Mbp and 19,212 genes is much more unusual and provides insight into the genetic consequences of reproduction by asexual parthenogenesis. Most of its genome is represented as pairs of homologous but divergent segments suggesting that despite being a parthenogenetic aneuploid species, M. \emph{incognita} is evolving towards effective haploidy. As the first obligate plant pathogenetic animal to be sequenced, M. \emph{incognita} could constitute a model for evaluating the impact of these mechanisms at the genomic scale. One of the most remarkable findings that has emerged from these two RKN genome studies is the identification of an extensive set of plant cell wall-degrading, carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), which has no counterpart in any other animal genome. All family members were possibly acquired by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) because the most similar genes are from those of unicellular organisms and bacteria. Finally, based on comparative analysis with nematodes from other ecological niches such as the free-living species and human parasites, we profile several approaches that are being explored using genome information toward the development of environmentally sustainable parasite control strategies and toward better understanding of the evolution and biology in plant-parasitic nematodes.},

Initially looking at antibodies, phospholipid fatty acid analysis and DNA as techniques to assess field variation, we go on to suggest that ecological genomics as a discipline can be used to unify the disparate areas of genetics, microbiology, biochemistry and ecology, in a co-evolutionary context. By way of examples, using Arthrobotrys, Trichoderma and Pasteuria penetrans, genomics is used, within its ecological framework, as a way to promote hypothesis driven research which hitherto has been impossible. With the advent of synthetic biology, we suggest that key genes important in compatible host-parasite populations and that can act synergistically, will lead to an approach that paves the way for the development of designer biological control agents.},

Evolutionary studies suggest that several distinct mechanisms have led to the acquisition of these effectors during the evolution of plant parasitism.

They induce the redifferentiation of root cells into specialized multinucleate and hypertrophied feeding cells essential for nematode growth and reproduction. Major rearrangements of the cytoskeleton occur during feeding cell formation. The first plant candidate proteins involved in giant cell actin and microtubule cytoskeleton reorganization were recently revealed and two of them, MAP65-3 and ADF2, have been shown to be essential for nematode-induced giant cell ontogenesis in Arabidopsis.

Their structural simplicity means that most nematodes, free-living or parasitic, have much in common with parallels in almost every facet of their biology. One major difference between the parasitic nematodes and their free-living cousins is their propensity for host interaction, a fact that is believed to have driven more rapid molecular evolutionary change as they strive to compete with their host for resources and survival in the face of host defence strategies. The fact that both animal and plant parasitism by nematodes arose independently on multiple occasions points to a diversity of starting points for their parasitic way of life. Despite this, animal and plant parasitic nematodes show many of the same traits that are believed to contribute to their success, including: their ability to arrest development at key stages in their life cycle; their ability to locate and infect their host; their ability to manipulate their interface with the host so that they can survive for extended periods and derive appropriate nutrients. Commonalities in the adoption of these strategies in both animal and plant parasites mean that there are many parallels between them, not just in their basic biology which is common across nematode life strategies, but in their parasite-specific adaptations and behaviours that enable them to succeed as infectious organisms living within and upon host species.},

  abstract = {Durability of plant disease resistance (R) genes may be predicted if the cost of pathogen adaptation to overcome resistance is understood. Adaptation of the bacterial blight pathogen, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), to virulence in rice is the result of the loss of pathogen avirulence gene function, but little is known about its effect on aggressiveness under field conditions. We evaluated the cost in pathogenic fitness (aggressiveness and persistence) associated with adaptation of Xoo to virulence on near-isogenic rice lines with single R genes (Xa7, Xa10, and Xa4) at two field sites endemic for bacterial blight. Disease severity was high in all 3 years on all lines except the fine with Xa7. Of two Xoo lineages (groups of strains inferred to be clonally related based on DNA fingerprinting) detected, one, lineage C, dominated the pathogen population at both sites. All Xoo strains were virulent to Xa4, whereas only lineage C strains were virulent to Xa10. Only a few strains of lineage C were virulent to Xa7. Adaptation to virulence on Xa7 occurred through at least four different pathways and was associated with a reduction in aggressiveness. Loss of avirulence and reduced aggressiveness were associated with mutations at the 3' terminus of the avrXa7 allele. Strains most aggressive to Xa7 were not detected after the second year, suggesting they were less persistent than less aggressive strains. These experiments support the prediction that Xa7 would be a durable R gene because of a fitness penalty in Xoo associated with adaptation to Xa7.},

However, accumulated data from analyses of experimental and natural populations of plant viruses are beginning to delineate some trends that often run contrary to accepted opinion: (1) high mutation rates are not necessarily adaptive, as a large fraction of the mutations are deleterious or lethal; (2) in spite of high potential for genetic variation, populations of plant viruses are not highly variable, and genetic stability is the rule rather than the exception; (3) the degree of constriction of genetic variation in virus-encoded proteins is similar to that in their eukaryotic hosts and vectors; and (4) in spite of huge census sizes of plant virus populations, selection is not the sole factor that shapes their evolution, and genetic drift may be important. Here, we review recent advances in understanding plant virus evolution, and describe the experimental and analytical methods most suited to this purpose.},

Location Global. Methods Current country- and state-level distributions of 1901 pests and pathogens and historical observation dates for 424 species were compared with potential distributions based upon distributions of host crops. The degree of `saturation', i.e. the fraction of the potential distribution occupied, was related to pest type, host range, crop production, climate and socioeconomic variables using linear models. Results More than one-tenth of all pests have reached more than half the countries that grow their hosts. If current trends continue, many important crop-producing countries will be fully saturated with pests by the middle of the century. While dispersal increases with host range overall, fungi have the narrowest host range but are the most widely dispersed group. The global dispersal of some pests has been rapid, but pest assemblages remain strongly regionalized and follow the distributions of their hosts. Pest assemblages are significantly correlated with socioeconomics, climate and latitude. Tropical staple crops, with restricted latitudinal ranges, tend to be more saturated with pests and pathogens than temperate staples with broad latitudinal ranges. We list the pests likely to be the most invasive in coming years. Main conclusions Despite ongoing dispersal of crop pests and pathogens, the degree of biotic homogenization of the globe remains moderate and regionally constrained, but is growing. Fungal pathogens lead the global invasion of agriculture, despite their more restricted host range. Climate change is likely to influence future distributions. Improved surveillance would reveal greater levels of invasion, particularly in developing countries.},

However, results have been inconclusive. We use previously parameterized and validated mathematical models of wheat Septoria leaf blotch and grapevine powdery mildew to test which tactic provides better resistance management, using the total yield before resistance causes disease control to become economically ineffective ("lifetime yield") to measure effectiveness. We focus on tactics involving the combination of a lowrisk and a high-risk fungicide, and the case in which resistance to the high-risk chemical is complete (i.e., in which there is no partial resistance). Lifetime yield is then optimized by spraying as much low-risk fungicide as is permitted, combined with slightly more high-risk fungicide than needed for acceptable initial disease control, applying these fungicides as a mixture. That mixture rather than alternation gives better performance is invariant to model parameterization and structure, as well as the pathosystem in question. However, if comparison focuses on other metrics, e.g., lifetime yield at full label dose, either mixture or alternation can be optimal. Our work shows how epidemiological principles can explain the evolution of fungicide resistance, and also highlights a theoretical framework to address the question of whether mixture or alternation provides better resistance management. It also demonstrates that precisely how spray tactics are compared must be given careful consideration.},

We show that models of fungicide resistance dynamics with and without density-dependent feedback give contrasting predictions on the effects of pathogen life-cycle parameters and the effects of the fungicide (dose, frequency, use of mixtures, spatial usage restrictions) on the evolution, invasion, and spread of fungicide resistance.

  abstract = {1 Soil-borne fungi are a major group of economically important plant pathogens, yet they have rarely been studied in the context of host-pathogen population biology. We develop general models of annual hosts and soil-borne fungal pathogens to explore the conditions for host-pathogen coexistence in both agricultural and natural plant populations. We use empirical data from the literature to parameterize and simulate dynamics with these models. 2 Initially we consider a simple system in which host density is assumed to be constant, as would be appropriate for agricultural systems. Model analysis shows that initial increase of the pathogen population requires that host (crop) density be above a threshold, this threshold decreases with increases in the pathogen's over-winter survival rate and ability to grow saprophytically. 3 A more complex model, in which both host and pathogen populations can vary, is needed for natural populations. Results from this model show that stable coexistence is possible even when the pathogen has a positive intrinsic growth rate (and therefore it is also possible for the pathogen to persist in the complete absence of the host). 4 Model parameter estimates were obtained from the empirical literature for two common and important soil pathogens: Phytophthora spp. and Fusarium oxysporum; these pathogens differ in several life-history features. Computer simulation showed that for Fusarium, there were substantial ranges for which coexistence or loss of the pathogen were predicted, while for Phytophthora most parameter estimates resulted in complete extinction when linear disease transmission was assumed; under the assumption of exponential disease transmission, predicted dynamics were most likely to lead to host persistence. 5 For both pathogens, within biologically realistic regions of parameter space, small changes in parameter values could lead to qualitatively different outcomes, including deterministic chaos, suggesting that long-term dynamics may be difficult to predict.},

  abstract = {Gene-for-gene (GFG) and matching-allele (MA) models are qualitatively different paradigms for describing the outcome of genetic interactions between hosts and pathogens. The GFG paradigm was largely built on the foundations of Flor's early work on the flax-flax rust interaction and is based on the concept of genetic recognition leading to incompatible disease outcomes, typical of host immune recognition. In contrast, the MA model is based on the assumption that genetic recognition leads to compatible interactions, which can result when pathogens require specific host factors to cause infection. Results from classical MA and GFG models have led to important predictions regarding various coevolutionary phenomena, including the role of fitness costs associated with resistance and infectivity, the distribution of resistance genes in wild populations, patterns of local adaptation and the evolution and maintenance of sexual reproduction. Empirical evidence (which we review briefly here), particularly from recent molecular advances in understanding of the mechanisms that determine the outcome of host-pathogen encounters, suggests considerable variation in specific details of the functioning of interactions between hosts and pathogens, which may contain elements of both models. In this regard, GFG and MA scenarios likely represent endpoints of a continuum of potentially more complex interactions that occur in nature. Increasingly, this has been recognized in theoretical studies of coevolutionary processes in plant host-pathogen and animal host-parasite associations (e.g., departures from strict GFG/MA assumptions, diploid genetics, multi-step infection processes). However, few studies have explored how different genetic assumptions about host resistance and pathogen infectivity might impact on disease epidemiology or pathogen persistence within and among populations. Here, we use spatially explicit simulations of the basic MA and GFG scenarios to highlight qualitative differences between these scenarios with regard to patterns of disease and impacts on host demography. Given that such impacts drive evolutionary trajectories, future theoretical advances that aim to capture more complex genetic scenarios should explicitly address the interaction between epidemiology and different models of host pathogen interaction genetics.},

  abstract = {Many epidemics of root diseases involving soil fungi depend on the interplay between fungal growth and the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the soil environment. Colonization or infection of a root occurs at fine scales with growth and movement of fungal mycelia through soil. However, epidemics are observed at coarser scales, and depend on a cascading spread through populations of roots. We briefly review conventional analyses of soil-borne epidemics and argue that these treat soil physical conditions at scales too coarse to be meaningful for interactions between soil, plants and fungi, and fail to consider the effect of soil physical conditions on the underlying epidemiological processes. Instead, we propose a conceptual epidemiological framework that integrates spatial scales and use this to review the effect of soil structure on the dynamics of soil-borne pathogenic fungi. Using the soil-borne fungal plant pathogen Rhizoctonia solani as an example, we demonstrate that invasion of fungi into host populations is critically affected by environmental conditions operating at each of two scales: (i) at the microscopic scale ({$\mu$}m - cm) the fungus preferentially explores certain pathways in soil, and small changes in soil physical conditions make the fungus switch from small, dense colonies to large, sparse and rapidly expanding ones; (ii) at the larger scale (cm - dm) a critical density of susceptible hosts is required, in excess of which fungi switch from non-invasive to invasive spread. Finally, we suggest that the approach will increase the applicability of research dealing with microscopic soil\textendash{}plant\textendash{}microbe interactions towards the solution of large-scale epidemiological problems.},

The potential exists to align these modeling approaches to evaluation of control practices and prediction of the consequent epidemic outcomes, but these have yet to make a major impact on practical disease management. For the immediate future simpler pragmatic approaches for analysis of disease progress, using nonlinear growth functions and/or integrated measures such as area under disease progress curves, will play a key role in informing tactical and strategic decisions on control treatments.

More stringent standards of proofs are demanded from model-based numbers, especially when these numbers represent potential financial losses, threats to human health or the state of the environment. Quantitative sensitivity analysis is generally agreed to be one such standard. Mathematical models are good at mapping assumptions into inferences. A modeller makes assumptions about laws pertaining to the system, about its status and a plethora of other, often arcane, system variables and internal model settings. To what extent can we rely on the model-based inference when most of these assumptions are fraught with uncertainties? Global Sensitivity Analysis offers an accessible treatment of such problems via~ quantitative sensitivity analysis, beginning with the first principles and guiding the reader through the full range of recommended practices with a rich set of solved exercises. The text explains the motivation for sensitivity analysis, reviews the required statistical concepts, and provides a guide to potential applications. The book:  Provides a self-contained treatment of the subject, allowing readers to learn and practice global sensitivity analysis without further materials.   Presents ways to frame the analysis, interpret its results, and avoid potential pitfalls.   Features numerous exercises and solved problems to help illustrate the applications.

This criterion, together with the definition of R0, is illustrated by treatment, multigroup, staged progression, multistrain and vector\textendash{}host models and can be applied to more complex models.

  abstract = {Farmers must yearly allocate fields to different crops and choose crop management options. Far from being obvious, these decisions are critical because they modify farm productivity and profitability in the short and long run. To support farmers and efficiently allocate scarce resources, decision support models are developed. Decision support models are mainly based on two concepts, the cropping plan and the crop rotation decisions. These decisions concern crop choice, crop spatial distribution within the farmland and crop temporal successions over years. Decisions are at the core of the farm management. Decisions have strong impacts on resource use efficiency and on environmental processes at both farm and landscape scales. We review here more than 120 references where cropping plan and crop rotation decision concepts were incorporated into models. Our aim is to review how these two concepts have been formalised and used in agronomic, economic and land-use studies. We found that cropping plan decisions selection and design have been done using many approaches based on different objectives and handled at very different scales. The main results show that (1) cropping plan design decisions have mainly been tackled as a static concept, i.e. as if they were a single decision made only once a year or once a rotation; (2) modelling the achievement of a suitable cropping plan is often based on a single monetary criterion optimization procedure instead of a multi-criteria assessment; and (3) when considered, uncertainty of information is defined as stochastic factors or probability of occurrence, but this probability is kept static whatever the knowledge of the dynamic evolution of various constraints. We argue that cropping plan and crop rotation decisions are on the contrary dynamic processes incorporated into a succession of other planned and adaptive decisions made at annual and long-term horizons. For supporting farmers in their decisions, new cropping plan decision models will require new modelling paradigm. A promising improvement could be reached by including explicitly the simulation of the farmers' decision-making processes, based on the simulation of the decision-making processes rather than on single normative approaches.},

  abstract = {The breakdown of plant resistance by pathogen populations is a limit to the genetic control of crop disease. Polygenic resistance is postulated as a durable alternative to defeated major resistance genes. Here, we tested this postulate in the pepper-Potato virus Y interaction. The virus was selected for virulence towards monogenic and polygenic host resistance, using serial inoculations in laboratory and in natural epidemic conditions. The frequency of resistance breakdown and the genetic changes in the virus avirulence gene were analysed. The monogenic resistance provided by the pvr2(3) gene was defeated at high frequency when introgressed in a susceptible genetic background whereas it was not when combined to partial resistance quantitative trait loci. The suppression of emergence of virulent mutants because of the genetic background resulted both from a differential selection effect and the necessity for the virus to generate multiple mutations. The virus adaptation to the polygenic resistance required a step-by-step selection with a primary selection for virulence towards the major gene, followed by selection for adaptation to the genetic background. Polygenic resistance proved more durable than monogenic resistance, but breeding strategies giving priority to major resistance factors may jeopardize the progress in durability expected from polygenic resistance.

  abstract = {The wheat stripe rust pathogen (Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici; Pst) was first detected in Australia in 1979. The features of the initial pathotype suggested that it was of European origin, and later work provided evidence that it was most likely transmitted as adherent spores on travellers' clothing. Despite long-held views that this cool temperature pathogen would not adapt to Australian conditions, Pst became endemic and progressively adapted to commercial wheat production through step-wise mutation. Several of these mutant pathotypes became frequent in the Pst population, causing widespread infection and significant costs to production (yield and quality losses; chemical control expenditure) in certain cultivars and seasons. Pathotype evolution, including adaptation to native barley grass (Hordeum spp.) populations, is described. The occurrence of an exotic pathotype of Pst in Western Australia in 2002, and its subsequent spread to eastern Australia, represented a major shift in the pathogen population. This pathotype dominated pathogen populations throughout Australia from 2003, with chemical control expenditure estimated at AU\$40\textendash{}90 million annually. Another exotic introduction was detected in 1998. Initial data indicated that certain isolates collected from barley grass were highly avirulent to wheat differentials, with the exception of partial virulence to Chinese 166. Further seedling tests revealed that these isolates, tentatively designated barley grass stripe rust (BGYR), were virulent on several Australian barleys, notably those of Skiff parentage. Data, including molecular studies, suggest that BGYR is a new forma specialis of P. striiformis. Field nurseries indicate that BGYR is likely to have little impact on commercial barley, although this may change with further pathotype evolution or the release of susceptible cultivars.},

Eventually, new techniques, including genetically modified organisms (GMOs) resistant to pests, could halt the massive spread of agrochemicals in agriculture fields. Biological chemical-free agriculture is gaining also more and more support but it is still not able to respond to the need for producing massive amounts of food. The use of agrochemicals, including pesticides, remains a common practice especially in tropical regions and South countries. Cheap compounds, such as DDT, HCH and lindane, that are environmentally persistent, are today banned from agriculture use in developed countries, but remain popular in developing countries. As a consequence, persistent residues of these chemicals contaminate food and disperse in the environment.

It encodes a protein of 1293 amino acids with a molecular mass of 149.4 kDa. The R1 gene belongs to the class of plant genes for pathogen resistance that have a leucine zipper motif, a putative nucleotide binding domain and a leucine-rich repeat domain. The most closely related plant resistance gene (36\% identity) is the Prf gene for resistance to Pseudomonas syringae of tomato. R1 is located within a hot spot for pathogen resistance on potato chromosome V.

  abstract = {Background: Plants have evolved efficient mechanisms to combat pathogen attack. One of the earliest responses to attempted pathogen attack is the generation of oxidative burst that can trigger hypersensitive cell death. This is called the hypersensitive response (HR) and is considered to be a major element of plant disease resistance. The HR is thought to deprive the pathogens of a supply of food and confine them to initial infection site. Necrotrophic pathogens, such as the fungi Botrytis cinerea and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, however, can utilize dead tissue. Results: Inoculation of B. cinerea induced an oxidative burst and hypersensitive cell death in Arabidopsis. The degree of B. cinerea and S. sclerotiorum pathogenicity was directly dependent on the level of generation and accumulation of superoxide or hydrogen peroxide. Plant cells exhibited markers of HR death, such as nuclear condensation and induction of the HR-specific gene HSR203J. Growth of B. cinerea was suppressed in the HR-deficient mutant dnd1, and enhanced by HR caused by simultaneous infection with an avirulent strain of the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae. HR had an opposite (inhibitory) effect on a virulent (biotrophic) strain of P. syringae. Moreover, H2O2 levels during HR correlated positively with B. cinerea growth but negatively with growth of virulent P. syringae. Conclusions: We show that, although hypersensitive cell death is efficient against biotrophic pathogens, it does not protect plants against infection by the necrotrophic pathogens B. cinerea and S. sclerotiorum. By contrast, B. cinerea triggers HR, which facilitates its colonization of plants. Hence, these fungi can exploit a host defense mechanism for their pathogenicity.},

  abstract = {Recent advances along numerous research avenues show that plant interactions with biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens use similar pathways with opposing effects. The hypersensitive response is associated with increased biotroph resistance but decreased necrotroph resistance. In plant/herbivore interactions, opposing effects of defenses against specialist versus generalist herbivores are controlled by plant secondary metabolites, where a metabolite that provides resistance to generalist herbivores may stimulate specialist herbivores. This multi-trophic interaction is presented as an ecological cost of plant resistance, but similar concepts are rarely applied to plant interactions with different classes of pathogens. In this review, we begin to describe how necrotrophic pathogens may place an ecological cost upon plant resistance to biotrophic pathogens. We separate these potential ecological costs into three concepts: (1) the local cost of the hypersensitive response, (2) organismal cost of having machinery for a hypersensitive response and (3) antagonism between salicylate and jasmonate signaling. We describe the literature supporting these concepts and some predictions that they generate. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We monitored the virulence dynamics of Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, the causal agent of wheat stripe rust, over 25 years in France. Virulence dynamics was explained by estimates of area associated with resistance genes carried by farmers' cultivars. The epidemics assessed through disease severity significantly correlated with the number of P. striiformis f. sp. tritici isolates collected each year, used to describe virulence dynamics. In the south, the dominance of the Mediterranean pathotype 6E16 and the cultivation of a susceptible cultivar were associated with an epidemic from 1997 to 1999. In the north, five epidemics occurred due to successive acquisition of virulence to the resistance genes Yr7, Yr6, Yr9, Yr17, and Yr32, either by acquisition of the virulence in the previous dominant pathotype or by incursion or selection of one or two new pathotypes. Frequency of pathotypes with Vr7 and Vr6 declined with the reduction in the cultivation of corresponding Yr gene cultivars, whereas the virulence Vr9 persisted longer than the cultivation of Yr9 cultivars. Although the first pathotypes carrying Vr9 decreased, this virulence persisted in other pathotypes even in the absence of Yr9 cultivars. At the regional level, Yr9 cultivars in the north caused a shift from high Vr6 frequency to high Vr9 frequency whereas, in the central region, where Yr9 cultivars were rare, Vr6 remained prevalent.},

A previous analysis of mutation rates in RNA viruses (specifically in riboviruses rather than retroviruses) was constrained by the quality and quantity of available measurements and by the lack of a specific theoretical framework for converting mutation frequencies into mutation rates in this group of organisms. Here, we describe a simple relation between ribovirus mutation frequencies and mutation rates, apply it to the best (albeit far from satisfactory) available data, and observe a central value for the mutation rate per genome per replication of {$\mu$}g {$\approx$} 0.76. (The rate per round of cell infection is twice this value or about 1.5.)

Extensive theoretical analyses of the factors that shape the evolution of pathogenicity and virulence have been reported in last three decades. Experimental work has not followed the path of theoretical analyses. Plant pathologists have shown greater interest in pathogenicity than in virulence, and our understanding of the molecular basis of pathogenicity has increased enormously. However, little is known regarding the molecular basis of virulence. It has been proposed that the mechanisms of recognition of parasites by hosts will have consequences for the evolution of pathogenicity, but much experimental work is still needed to test these hypotheses. Much theoretical work has been based on evidence from cellular plant pathogens. We review here the current experimental and observational evidence on which to test theoretical hypotheses or conjectures. We compare evidence from viruses and cellular pathogens, mostly fungi and oomycetes, which differ widely in genomic complexity and in parasitism. Data on the evolution of pathogenicity and virulence from viruses and fungi show important differences, and their comparison is necessary to establish the generality of hypotheses on pathogenicity and virulence evolution.},

On the basis of an analysis of cellular plant pathogens, it was recently proposed that the evolutionary potential of a pathogen is a major determinant of the durability of resistance. We test this hypothesis for plant viruses, which differ substantially from cellular pathogens in the nature, size, and expression of their genomes. Our analysis was based on 29 plant virus species that provide a good representation of the genetic and biological diversity of plant viruses. These 29 viruses were involved in 35 pathosystems, and 50 resistance factors deployed against them were analyzed. Resistance was found to be durable more often than not, in contrast with resistance to cellular plant pathogens. In a third of the analyzed pathosystems RB strains have not been reported, and in another third RB strains have been reported but have not become prevalent in the virus population. The evolutionary potential of the viruses in the 35 pathosystems was evaluated with a compound risk index based on three evolutionary factors: the population of the pathogen, the degree of recombination, and the amount of gene and genotype flow. Our analysis indicates that evolutionary potential may be an important determinant of the durability of resistance against plant viruses.},

The race structure of L. maculans was assessed on the basis of the analysis of 1011 isolates collected in France between 1990 and 2000, with regards to three AVR genes, AvrLm1, AvrLm2 and AvrLm4. The effect of selection pressure, due to large-scale cropping of Rlm1 cultivars, on the evolution of races of the fungus was also evaluated. The results revealed a scarcity or complete absence of isolates harbouring AvrLm2, whereas isolates harbouring AvrLm4 were present at a variable level, that was as high as 17.2\textendash{}31.2\% depending on the sample year and location. When obtained from rlm1 cultivars, isolates harbouring AvrLm1 always represented more than 83\% of the populations until the 1997\textendash{}1998 growing season. As a consequence, the Rlm1 cultivars had been highly efficient at controlling the disease and were grown on an estimated 43.7\% of the total French acreage in OSR in 1998\textendash{}1999. However, the increased commercial success of Rlm1 cultivars was paralleled by a decrease in the proportion of isolates harbouring AvrLm1 in 1997\textendash{}1998 and 1998\textendash{}1999. This resulted in less than 13\% of isolates harbouring AvrLm1 in populations being collected from rlm1 cultivars in 1999 and 2000, and contributed to the loss of efficiency of the Rlm1 resistance in the field. The present study is an illustration of one round of a `boom and bust' cycle that occurred for a pathosystem where it has never been reported before. These data and the high evolutionary potential of L. maculans are fully supportive of one pathogen species with a high risk of breaking down resistance genes in OSR and suggest that the development of integrated strategies aiming at maximising the durability of novel resistance is now a priority for this pathosystem.},

Although they both suppressed nematode reproduction, the two resistance genes induced very different response patterns. First, significantly fewer J2 were able to invade roots of HDA149 compared to HDA330. Second, while ultrastructural changes typical to the hypersensitive reaction (HR) occurred in root cells of HDA149 early after nematode inoculation (i.e. necrosis of cells directly involved in nematode penetration and feeding), the resistance mechanism in HDA330 involved a delayed plant response (i.e. cell senescence and death) which took place after the induction of a number of (imperfect) giant cells by the nematode. These differential responses are discussed in relation to the nematode ability to circumvent or not the resistance gene(s), and it is suggested that such virulence could result from the overcoming by the J2 of the early HR occurring within the epidermis and cortex of the root.},

Resistance of CM334 to root-knot nematodes was associated with unidentified factors that limited nematode penetration and with post-penetration biochemical responses, including the hypersensitive response, which apparently blocked nematode migration and thereby prevented juvenile development and reproduction. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis suggested that phenolic compounds, especially chlorogenic acid, may be involved in CM334 resistance. The response to infection in the resistant line varied with root-knot nematode species and was correlated with nematode behavior and pathogenicity in the susceptible cultivar: nematode species that quickly reached the vascular cylinder and initiated feeding sites in the susceptible cultivar were quickly recognized in CM334 and stopped in the epidermis or cortex. After comparing our data with those from other resistant pepper lines, we suggest that timing of the resistance response and the mechanism of resistance vary with plant genotype, resistance gene, and root-knot nematode species.},

Modulation of the evolutionary forces acting on pathogen populations constitutes a promising way to increase the durability of these genes. We studied the effect of four plant traits affecting these evolutionary forces on the rate of resistance breakdown (RB) by a virus. Two of these traits correspond to virus effective population sizes (Ne) at either plant inoculation or during infection. The third trait corresponds to differential selection exerted by the plant on the virus population. Finally, the fourth trait corresponds to within-plant virus accumulation (VA). These traits were measured experimentally on Potato virus Y (PVY) inoculated to a set of 84 pepper doubled-haploid lines, all carrying the same pvr23 resistance gene, but having contrasting genetic backgrounds. The lines showed extensive variation for the rate of pvr23 RB by PVY and for the four other traits of interest. A generalized linear model showed that three of these four traits, with the exception of Ne at inoculation, and several pairwise interactions between them had significant effects on RB. RB increased with increasing values of Ne during plant infection or VA. The effect of differential selection was more complex because of a strong interaction with VA. When VA was high, RB increased as the differential selection increased. An opposite relationship between RB and differential selection was observed when VA was low. This study provides a framework to select plants with appropriate virus evolution-related traits to avoid or delay RB.},

In this review, we discuss Leonard's classic model of the effects of host genotype diversity on disease and its predictions of disease level based on the proportion of susceptible host tissue. As a refinement to Leonard's model, the spatial structure of host and pathogen population can be taken into account by considering factors such as autoinfection, interaction between host size and pathogen dispersal gradients, lesion expansion, and host carrying capacity for disease. The genetic composition of the host population also can be taken into account by considering differences in race-specific resistance among host genotypes, compensation, plant competition, and competitive interactions among pathogen genotypes. The magnitude of host-diversity effects for particular host-pathogen systems can be predicted by considering how the inherent characteristics of a system causes it to differ from the assumptions of the classic model. Because of the limited number of studies comparing host-diversity effects in different systems, it is difficult at this point to make more than qualitative predictions. Environmental conditions and management decisions also influence host-diversity effects on disease through their effect on factors such as host density and epidemic length and intensity.},

By using the principle that the population frequency of nonviable genotypes equals the mutation rate, we screened for changes that inactivated the hammerheads of Chrysanthemum chlorotic mottle viroid. We obtained a mutation rate of 1/400 per site, the highest reported for any biological entity. Such error-prone replication can only be tolerated by extremely simple genomes such as those of viroids and, presumably, the primitive replicons of the RNA world. Our results suggest that the emergence of replication fidelity was critical for the evolution of complexity in the early history of life.

  abstract = {To develop molecular markers linked to the L-4 locus conferring resistance to tobamovirus pathotypes in pepper plants, we performed AFLP with 512 primer combinations for susceptible (S pool) and resistant (R pool) DNA bulks against pathotype 1.2 of pepper mild mottle virus. Each bulk was made by pooling the DNA of five homozygous individuals from a T10 population, which was a near-isogenic BC4F2 generation for the L-4 locus. A total of 19 primer pairs produced scorable bands in the R pool. Further screening with these primer pairs was done on DNA bulks from T102, a BC10F2 derived from T10 by back crossing. Three AFLP markers were finally selected and designated L4-a, L4-b and L4-c. L4-a and L4-c each underwent one recombination event, whereas no recombination for L4-b was seen in 20 individuals of each DNA bulk. Linkage analysis of these markers in 112 F-2 T102 individuals showed that they were each within 2.5 cM of the L-4 locus. L4-b was successfully converted into a simple 340-bp SCAR marker, designated L4SC340, which mapped 1.8 cM from the L-4 locus in T102 and 0.9 cM in another BC10F2 population, T101. We believe that this newly characterized marker will improve selection of tobamovirus resistance in pepper plants by reducing breeding cost and time.},

To identify the differential host conditions associated with this phenomenon, cellular accumulation, cell-to-cell movement, vascular translocation, and foliar content of PVYNN were comparatively evaluated. Virus cell-to-cell movement was restricted and its transit through the vasculature boundaries was completely blocked in both tobacco varieties. However, an additional defense mechanism operating only in tobacco VAM drastically reduced the in situ cellular virus accumulation. Genetic analyses of hybrid plant progenies indicate that VAM-type resistance was conditioned by at least two recessive genes: va and a newly reported va2 locus. Moreover, segregant plant progenies that restricted virus movement but permitted normal virus accumulation were prone to develop resistance-breaking infections. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

I discuss how multiple infections have been modelled in evolutionary epidemiology. First, I briefly mention within-host models, which are at the root of these epidemiological models. Then, I present the super-infection framework, with an original focus on how the definition of the super-infection function can lead to evolutionary branching. There are several co-infection models and, for each of them, I briefly go through the underlying mathematics (especially the invasion fitness of a mutant strain) and I discuss the biological assumptions they make and the questions they consequently may ask. In particular, I show that a widely used co-infection model should not be invoked for invasion analyses because it confers a frequency-dependent advantage to rare neutral mutants. Finally, I present more recent frameworks, such as the Price equation framework in epidemiology, that can account for increased parasite diversity. To conclude, I discuss some perspectives for the study of multiple infections in evolutionary epidemiology.},

  abstract = {Co-infection of individual hosts by multiple parasite species is a pattern that is very commonly observed in natural populations. Understanding the processes that generate these patterns poses a challenge. For example, it is difficult to discern the relative roles of exposure and susceptibility in generating the mixture and density of parasites within hosts. Yet discern them we must, if we are to design and deliver successful medical interventions for co-infected populations. Here, we synthesise an emergent understanding of how processes operate and interact to generate patterns of co-infection. We consider within-host communities (or infracommunities) generally, that is including not only classical parasites but also the microbiota that are so abundant on mucosal surfaces and which are increasingly understood to be so influential on host biology. We focus on communities that include a helminth, but we expect similar inferences to pertain to other taxa. We suggest that, thanks to recent research at both the within-host (e.g. immunological) and between-host (e.g. epidemiological) scales, researchers are poised to reveal the processes that generate the observed distribution of parasite communities among hosts. Progress will be facilitated by using new technologies as well as statistical and experimental tools to test competing hypotheses about processes that might generate patterns in co-infection data. By understanding the multiple interactions that underlie patterns of co-infection, we will be able to understand and intelligently predict how a suite of co-infections (and thus the host that bears them) will together respond to medical interventions as well as other environmental changes. The challenge for us all is to become scholars of co-infections.},

A better understanding of the principles and consequences of competition can be useful in designing more sustainable disease management strategies. The competitive ability and relative fitness of a pathogen strain are determined by its intrinsic biological properties, the resistance and heterogeneity of the corresponding host population, the population density and genetic relatedness of the competing strains, and the physical environment. Competitive ability can be inferred indirectly from fitness components, such as basic reproduction rate or transmission rate. However, pathogen strains that exhibit higher fitness components when they infect a host alone may not exhibit a competitive advantage when they co-infect the same host. The most comprehensive measures of competitive ability and relative fitness come from calculating selection coefficients in a mixed infection in a field setting. Mark-release-recapture experiments can be used to estimate fitness costs associated with unnecessary virulence and fungicide resistance.},

Triggered by these economical losses, detailed studies of the parasitic interaction have been performed, which resulted in an extensive descriptive knowledge. However, the underlying biochemical and molecular events of this intimate relationship have still not been elucidated. It is generally accepted that secretions produced by the nematode are responsible for the dramatic alteration of specific cells in the host plant. In the past few years, the identification of genes coding for secreted proteins was a breakthrough in plant nematode research. However, the available information is still too limited to allow the formulation of a comprehensive model, mainly because the sequences of many of these genes are novel with no similar sequence found in the existing databases.

  abstract = {Since its origins, thousands of years ago, agriculture has been challenged by the presence of evolving plant pathogens. Temporal rotations of host and non-host crops have helped farmers to control epidemics among other utilities, but further efforts for strategy assessment are needed. Here, we present a methodology for developing crop rotation strategies optimal for control of pathogens informed by numerical simulations of eco-evolutionary dynamics in one field. This approach can integrate agronomic criteria used in crop rotations\textemdash{}soil quality and cash yield\textemdash{}and the analysis of pathogen evolution in systems where hosts are artificially selected. Our analysis shows which rotation patterns perform better in maximising crop yield when an unspecified infection occurs, with yield being dependent on both soil quality and the strength of the epidemic. Importantly, the use of non-host crops, which both improve soil quality and control the epidemic results in similar rational rotation strategies for diverse agronomic and infection conditions. We test the repeatability of the best rotation patterns over multiple decades, an essential end-user goal. Our results provide sustainable strategies for optimal resource investment for increased food production and lead to further insights into the minimisation of pesticide use in a society demanding ever more efficient agriculture.},

RNA interference has been used in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to manipulate gene expression3,4. Here we investigate the requirements for structure and delivery of the interfering RNA. To our surprise, we found that double-stranded RNA was substantially more effective at producing interference than was either strand individually. After injection into adult animals, purified single strands had at most a modest effect, whereas double-stranded mixtures caused potent and specific interference. The effects of this interference were evident in both the injected animals and their progeny. Only a few molecules of injected double-stranded RNA were required per affected cell, arguing against stochiometric interference with endogenous mRNA and suggesting that there could be a catalytic or amplification component in the interference process.},

  issn = {1553-7404},
  abstract = {Root-knot nematodes (genus \emph{Meloidogyne}) exhibit a diversity of reproductive modes ranging from obligatory sexual to fully asexual reproduction. Intriguingly, the most widespread and devastating species to global agriculture are those that reproduce asexually, without meiosis. To disentangle this surprising parasitic success despite the absence of sex and genetic exchanges, we have sequenced and assembled the genomes of three obligatory ameiotic and asexual \emph{Meloidogyne}. We have compared them to those of relatives able to perform meiosis and sexual reproduction. We show that the genomes of ameiotic asexual \emph{Meloidogyne} are large, polyploid and made of duplicated regions with a high within-species average nucleotide divergence of \textasciitilde{}8\%. Phylogenomic analysis of the genes present in these duplicated regions suggests that they originated from multiple hybridization events and are thus homoeologs. We found that up to 22\% of homoeologous gene pairs were under positive selection and these genes covered a wide spectrum of predicted functional categories. To biologically assess functional divergence, we compared expression patterns of homoeologous gene pairs across developmental life stages using an RNAseq approach in the most economically important asexually-reproducing nematode. We showed that {$>$}60\% of homoeologous gene pairs display diverged expression patterns. These results suggest a substantial functional impact of the genome structure. Contrasting with high within-species nuclear genome divergence, mitochondrial genome divergence between the three ameiotic asexuals was very low, signifying that these putative hybrids share a recent common maternal ancestor. Transposable elements (TE) cover a \textasciitilde{}1.7 times higher proportion of the genomes of the ameiotic asexual \emph{Meloidogyne} compared to the sexual relative and might also participate in their plasticity. The intriguing parasitic success of asexually-reproducing \emph{Meloidogyne} species could be partly explained by their TE-rich composite genomes, resulting from allopolyploidization events, and promoting plasticity and functional divergence between gene copies in the absence of sex and meiosis.},

  abstract = {Adaptation to changing environmental conditions represents a challenge to parthenogenetic organisms, and until now, how phenotypic variants are generated in clones in response to the selection pressure of their environment remains poorly known. The obligatory parthenogenetic root-knot nematode species \emph{Meloidogyne} \emph{incognita} has a worldwide distribution and is the most devastating plant-parasitic nematode. Despite its asexual reproduction, this species exhibits an unexpected capacity of adaptation to environmental constraints, for example, resistant hosts. Here, we used a genomewide comparative hybridization strategy to evaluate variations in gene copy numbers between genotypes of M. \emph{incognita} resulting from two parallel experimental evolution assays on a susceptible vs. resistant host plant. We detected gene copy number variations (CNVs) associated with the ability of the nematodes to overcome resistance of the host plant, and this genetic variation may reflect an adaptive response to host resistance in this parthenogenetic species. The CNV distribution throughout the nematode genome is not random and suggests the occurrence of genomic regions more prone to undergo duplications and losses in response to the selection pressure of the host resistance. Furthermore, our analysis revealed an outstanding level of gene loss events in nematode genotypes that have overcome the resistance. Overall, our results support the view that gene loss could be a common class of adaptive genetic mechanism in response to a challenging new biotic environment in clonal animals.},

  abstract = {Root-knot nematodes (RKNs) heavily damage most solanaceous crops worldwide. Fortunately, major resistance genes are available in a number of plant species, and their use provides a safe and economically relevant strategy for RKN control. From a structural point of view, these genes often harbour NBS\textendash{}LRR motifs (i.e. a nucleotide binding site and a leucine rich repeat region near the carboxy terminus) and are organised in syntenic clusters in solanaceous genomes. Their introgression from wild to cultivated plants remains a challenge for breeders, although facilitated by marker-assisted selection. As shown with other pathosystems, the genetic background into which the resistance genes are introgressed is of prime importance to both the expression of the resistance and its durability, as exemplified by the recent discovery of quantitative trait loci conferring quantitative resistance to RKNs in pepper. The deployment of resistance genes at a large scale may result in the emergence and spread of virulent nematode populations able to overcome them, as already reported in tomato and pepper. Therefore, careful management of the resistance genes available in solanaceous crops is crucial to avoid significant reduction in the duration of RKN genetic control in the field. From that perspective, only rational management combining breeding and cultivation practices will allow the design and implementation of innovative, sustainable crop production systems that protect the resistance genes and maintain their durability. \textcopyright{} 2015 Society of Chemical Industry},

Based on a simple linear extension of past trends, the anticipated next doubling of global food production would be associated with approximately 3-fold increases in nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization rates, a doubling of the irrigated land area, and an 18\% increase in cropland. These projected changes would have dramatic impacts on the diversity, composition, and functioning of the remaining natural ecosystems of the world, and on their ability to provide society with a variety of essential ecosystem services. The largest impacts would be on freshwater and marine ecosystems, which would be greatly eutrophied by high rates of nitrogen and phosphorus release from agricultural fields. Aquatic nutrient eutrophication can lead to loss of biodiversity, outbreaks of nuisance species, shifts in the structure of food chains, and impairment of fisheries. Because of aerial redistribution of various forms of nitrogen, agricultural intensification also would eutrophy many natural terrestrial ecosystems and contribute to atmospheric accumulation of greenhouse gases. These detrimental environmental impacts of agriculture can be minimized only if there is much more efficient use and recycling of nitrogen and phosphorus in agroecosystems.},

Two years of continuous corn or grain sorghum, wheat followed by 'HT-5203' soybean, or 2-year fallow, reduced both dagger nematode density in the soil and SSS severity. Crop rotation to the SSSV-tolerant HT-5203 soybean as a single crop for 2 years increased dagger nematode populations and SSS severity.

During this period, integrated low-input strategies have been developed for winter wheat, to cope with falling grain prices and growing environmental concerns. We investigated the interactions between genotype and management for disease and lodging intensities, and analysed their effects on yield within an integrated crop management (CM) context. A multi-environment experimental network (13 locations, studied in three seasons, between 1999-2000 and 2001-2002) comprising several combinations of cultivars and CM systems was carried out. Four rule-based CM plans were defined, with a decrease in input level from CM1 (a high-input CM plan designed to maximise the yield of a given cultivar) to CM4 (a low-input system with no fungicide protection, no plant growth regulator applications, a sowing density 40\% lower than for CM1, and 90 kg ha(-1) less N fertiliser than for CM1). Cultivars were clustered into three groups (cultivar type (CT) CT1-CT3), according to their scores for resistance to diseases, for the analysis of yield, whereas the resistance cultivar rating (CR) for each disease and for lodging was considered for the analysis of disease and lodging intensities. For all diseases, CM had a significant effect (P{$<$}0.0001), with disease intensity increasing from CM1 to CM4, whereas CR had a negative effect (P{$<$}0.005). An interaction between CR and CM was also detected for all diseases (P{$<$}0.005) except eyespot. Lodging intensity decreased significantly from CM1 to CM4 (P{$<$}0.0001), and significant increases in lodging resistance score (P{$<$}0.0001) were not associated with a genotype by management interaction. Lastly, yield was significantly affected by CM (P {$<$} 0.0001), CT (P {$<$} 0.0003), and CM by CT interaction (P = 0.0023). Cultivar ranking differed as a function of CM for yield, demonstrating that breeding programs focusing on cultivar evaluation in high-input environments do not result in the selection of cultivars suited to low-input environments.

                  its current adult form. I argue on why it has taken
                  so long for the concept to mature in epidemiology
                  when there were ample opportunities for
                  cross-fertilisation from demography and ecology from
                  where it reached adulthood fifty years
                  earlier. Today, R0 is a more fully developed adult
                  in epidemiology than in demography. In the final
                  section I give an algorithm for its calculation in
                  heterogeneous populations.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with the effects of agronomic practices on parasite life cycles, and the design of integrated crop protection strategies. Cropping systems have a large effect on the size of the primary inoculum and its localisation, on the development and spread of epidemics, and on the coordination of the life cycle of cultivated plants and that of their parasites. They can disrupt ecological equilibria, either favouring or disfavouring the pathogens. By combining information concerning the effects of agricultural techniques on diseases and the physiological effects of diseases on growth and crop production, it is now possible to develop new crop management systems, in which the use of non-chemical methods for preventing diseases is a priority. However, the cur-rent knowledge need to be completed by studies on other scales, particularly of the effect of cropping systems on the genetics of disease populations integrating more completely the 'long-term' dimension of sustainable agriculture.

Their physiological age at the time of the later inoculations was reduced (retardation of development), which made them more sensitive to weight reduction by the nematodes than uninoculated plants of the same actual age. The plants were less tolerant to nematodes already present at sowing than to those introduced into the soil later but which attacked the same roots at the same time.

The problems of sampling field populations have been much studied and population structure is similar to that of other animals. Immigration and emigration are negligible so that population fluctuations can be investigated in pots or small field plots. The relationship between initial and final population densities during one growing season is described by an equation derived from the logistic equation which takes into account the damage caused to the root system by nematode attack and the fact that not all eggs hatch.

  volume = {25},
  issn = {0269-7653},
  abstract = {This paper explores the effect of discontinuous periodic host absence on the evolution of pathogen transmission rates by using R-0 maximisation techniques. The physiological consequence of an increased transmission rate can be either an increased virulence, i.e. there is a transmission-virulence trade-off or ii) a reduced between season survival, i.e. there is a transmission-survival trade-off. The results reveal that the type of trade-off determines the direction of selection, with relatively longer periods of host absence selecting for higher transmission rates in the presence of a trade-off between transmission and virulence but lower transmission rates in the presence of a trade-off between transmission and between season survival. The fact that for the transmission-virulence trade-off both trade-off parameters operate during host presence whereas for the transmission-survival trade-off one operates during host presence (transmission) and the other (survival) during the period of host absence is the main cause for this difference in selection direction. Moreover, the period of host absence seems to be the key determinant of the pathogen's transmission rate. Comparing plant patho-systems with contrasting biological features suggests that airborne plant pathogens respond differently to longer periods of host absence than soil-borne plant pathogens.},

  abstract = {1. A theoretical model of winter survival dynamics of \emph{Meloidogyne} spp. (Jeger \& Starr 1985) was extended to incorporate the loss of egg viability and population losses due to predation or microbial decomposition. 2. The model was used to estimate rates of egg hatching, egg viability loss, egg population loss and juvenile mortality; also, initial populations of viable and non-viable eggs and juveniles, and the cumulative number of eggs that lost viability of M. \emph{incognita} in cotton field plots at College Station, Texas, and of M. hapla in rose (Rosa sp.) plots at Overton, Texas, in 1984-85. 3. It was estimated that 47\% of eggs lost viability during the winter at College Station and 19\% at Overton. Egg population losses due to predation or microbial decomposition were important in the overwintering, but it is not known whether these affected viable and non viable eggs equally. 4. There appeared to be a net migration of juveniles from shallow to deep soil profiles: a further complicating factor that is not accounted for in the current model. 5. Problems in fitting the overwintering model to field data were encountered because of common parameters in the component equations comprising the model. Additionally, there were large sampling errors and biases encountered in nematode sampling that caused problems in fitting the overwintering model in some years and locations.},

Although it is known to have profound effects on plant pathogen abundance, the evolutionary consequences of periodicity for the pathogen population have not previously been analyzed. An epidemiological model incorporating periodic absence of the host crop is combined with the theory of adaptive dynamics to determine whether or not seasonality in host presence plays a role in the occurrence of evolutionary branching, leading to coexisting yet genetically distinct pathogen phenotypes. The study is motivated and illustrated by the specific example of take-all disease of wheat, caused by the pathogen Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici, for which two coexisting but genetically distinct types and a tradeoff related to seasonality in host presence have been identified. Numerical simulations are used to show that a trade-off between the pathogen transmission rate and the survival of the pathogen between cropping seasons cannot account for the evolutionary branching observed in many pathogens. Model elaborations show that this conclusion holds for a broad range of putative mechanisms. Although the analysis is motivated and illustrated by the specific example of take-all of wheat, the results apply to a broad range of pathogens.},

  abstract = {Parasites exploit an inherently patchy resource, their hosts, which are discrete entities that may only be available for infection within a relatively short time window. However, there has been little consideration of how heterogeneities in host availability may affect the phenotypic or genotypic composition of parasite populations or how parasites may evolve to cope with them. Here we conduct a selection experiment involving an entomopathogenic nematode (Steinernema feltiae) and show for the first time that the infection rate of a parasite can evolve rapidly to maximize the chances of infecting within an environment characterized by the rate of host availability. Furthermore, we show that the parasite's infection rate trades off with other fitness traits, such as fecundity and survival. Crucially, the outcome of competition between strains with different infection strategies depends on the rate of host availability; frequently available hosts favor "fast" infecting nematodes, whereas infrequently available hosts favor "slow" infecting nematodes. A simple evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) analysis based on classic epidemiological models fails to capture this behavior, predicting instead that the fastest infecting phenotype should always dominate. However, a novel model incorporating more realistic, discrete bouts of host availability shows that strain coexistence is highly likely. Our results demonstrate that heterogeneities in host availability play a key role in the evolution of parasite life-history traits and in the maintenance of phenotypic variability. Parasite life-history strategies are likely to evolve rapidly in response to changes in host availability induced by disease management programs or by natural dynamics in host abundance. Incorporating parasite evolution in response to host availability would therefore enhance the predictive ability of current epidemiological models of infectious disease.},

  abstract = {The coexistence of closely related plant parasites is widespread. Yet, understanding the ecological determinants of evolutionary divergence in plant parasites remains an issue. Niche differentiation through resource specialization has been widely researched, but it hardly explains the coexistence of parasites exploiting the same host plant. Time-partitioning has so far received less attention, although in temperate climates, parasites may specialize on either the early or the late season. Accordingly, we investigated whether seasonality can also promote phenotypic divergence. For plant parasites, seasonality generally engenders periodic host absence. To account for abrupt seasonal events, we made use of an epidemic model that combines continuous and discrete dynamics. Based on the assumption of a trade-off between in-season transmission and inter-season survival, we found through an "evolutionary invasion analysis" that evolutionary divergence of the parasite phenotype can occur. Since such a trade-off has been reported, this study provides further ecological bases for the coexistence of closely related plant parasites. Moreover, this study provides original insights into the coexistence of sibling plant pathogens which perform either a single or several infection cycles within a season (mono- and polycyclic diseases, or uni- and multivoltine life cycles).},

We present a framework for analysis of complexity in climate-change effects mediated by plant disease. This framework can support evaluation of the level of model complexity likely to be required for analysing climate-change impacts mediated by disease. Our analysis incorporates consideration of the following set of questions for a particular host, pathogen, host\textendash{}pathogen combination, or geographic region. 1. Are multiple biological interactions important? 2. Are there environmental thresholds for population responses? 3. Are there indirect effects of global change factors on disease development? 4. Are spatial components of epidemic processes affected by climate? 5. Are there feedback loops for management? 6. Are networks for intervention technologies slower than epidemic networks? 7. Are there effects of plant disease on multiple ecosystem services? 8. Are there feedback loops from plant disease to climate change? Evaluation of these questions will help in gauging system complexity, as illustrated for fusarium head blight and potato late blight. In practice, it may be necessary to expand models to include more components, identify those components that are the most important, and synthesize such models to include the optimal level of complexity for planning and research prioritization.},

We examined the trends in crop yields for four key global crops: maize, rice, wheat and soybeans.

  abstract = {Concerns about sustainability in agricultural systems centre on the need to develop technologies and practices that do not have adverse effects on environmental goods and services, are accessible to and effective for farmers, and lead to improvements in food productivity. Despite great progress in agricultural productivity in the past half-century, with crop and livestock productivity strongly driven by increased use of fertilizers, irrigation water, agricultural machinery, pesticides and land, it would be over-optimistic to assume that these relationships will remain linear in the future. New approaches are needed that will integrate biological and ecological processes into food production, minimize the use of those non-renewable inputs that cause harm to the environment or to the health of farmers and consumers, make productive use of the knowledge and skills of farmers, so substituting human capital for costly external inputs, and make productive use of people's collective capacities to work together to solve common agricultural and natural resource problems, such as for pest, watershed, irrigation, forest and credit management. These principles help to build important capital assets for agricultural systems: natural; social; human; physical; and financial capital. Improving natural capital is a central aim, and dividends can come from making the best use of the genotypes of crops and animals and the ecological conditions under which they are grown or raised. Agricultural sustainability suggests a focus on both genotype improvements through the full range of modern biological approaches and improved understanding of the benefits of ecological and agronomic management, manipulation and redesign. The ecological management of agroecosystems that addresses energy flows, nutrient cycling, population-regulating mechanisms and system resilience can lead to the redesign of agriculture at a landscape scale. Sustainable agriculture outcomes can be positive for food productivity, reduced pesticide use and carbon balances. Significant challenges, however, remain to develop national and international policies to support the wider emergence of more sustainable forms of agricultural production across both industrialized and developing countries.},

  abstract = {During the last 50 years, agricultural intensification has caused many wild plant and animal species to go extinct regionally or nationally and has profoundly changed the functioning of agro-ecosystems. Agricultural intensification has many components, such as loss of landscape elements, enlarged farm and field sizes and larger inputs of fertilizer and pesticides. However, very little is known about the relative contribution of these variables to the large-scale negative effects on biodiversity. In this study, we disentangled the impacts of various components of agricultural intensification on species diversity of wild plants, carabids and ground-nesting farmland birds and on the biological control of aphids. In a Europe-wide study in eight West and East European countries, we found important negative effects of agricultural intensification on wild plant, carabid and bird species diversity and on the potential for biological pest control, as estimated from the number of aphids taken by predators. Of the 13 components of intensification we measured, use of insecticides and fungicides had consistent negative effects on biodiversity. Insecticides also reduced the biological control potential. Organic farming and other agri-environment schemes aiming to mitigate the negative effects of intensive farming on biodiversity did increase the diversity of wild plant and carabid species, but - contrary to our expectations - not the diversity of breeding birds. We conclude that despite decades of European policy to ban harmful pesticides, the negative effects of pesticides on wild plant and animal species persist, at the same time reducing the opportunities for biological pest control. If biodiversity is to be restored in Europe and opportunities are to be created for crop production utilizing biodiversity-based ecosystem services such as biological pest control, there must be a Europe-wide shift towards farming with minimal use of pesticides over large areas.

  abstract = {A 2-year study with six soils and four levels of \emph{Meloidogyne} \emph{incognita} in microplots was designed to determine the effects of these parameters on nematode activity and tobacco yield and quality. Key components under study were affected by soil, nematode level, and season (year-cultivar). In 1980, low initial nematode numbers (1,250) enhanced tobacco yield in Cecil clay loam, but caused slight to moderate yield losses in the other soils. Yield losses to M. \emph{incognita} were generally greatest in sandy and muck soils. In 1980, regression analyses of the independent parameters Pi-clay-sand vs. yield gave an R2 of 0.40. Examples of other coefficients of determination for yield vs. selected factors were root-necrosis index, 0.40; root-gall index, 0.18; root-gall index-cation exchange capacity (CEC), 0.34; root-necrosis index-CEC, 0.56; and root-necrosis index-sand-soil acidity-calcium, 0.62. In contrast, the R2 for Pi alone versus yield in 1981 was 0.84. Soil also affected nematode reproduction with the greatest increases occurring in the sandy soils. In both years, low nematode numbers enhanced the synthesis of sugar in tobacco, whereas leaves from all other nematode treatments had low sugar levels. A low nicotine content was associated with nematode infection. Tobacco from sandy soils had a higher nicotine content than tobacco from clay soils.},

The lowest Pf of M. \emph{incognita} occurred after velvetbean at all seven sites, but Pf after cowpea were equivalent to Pf after velvetbean at four of seven sites. Cultivar choice is critical in planning rotations to suppress M. \emph{incognita} because results obtained here and elsewhere have shown great differences among sorghum and cowpea cultivars. The Pf of Pratylenchus spp. were lowest following velvetbean at four of seven sites. There were no differences in densities of Paratrichodorus minor among crops, but populations increased at a greater rate if initial density (Pi) was low. Multiplication rates (Pf/Pi) of most nematode species on most crops varied inversely with Pi. An accurate impression of nematode multiplication and host status could not be obtained unless a range of Pi was examined.},

In 1989, higher final densities (mean of 1,171 juveniles [J2]/100 cm{$^3$} soil) were obtained in plots inoculated with 0.5 to 50 eggs/100 cm{$^3$} soil than in plots inoculated with 100 to 200 eggs/100 cm{$^3$} (313 J2/100 cm{$^3$} soil).

Pod yield and dry weight of foliage at harvest were negatively correlated (P {$\leq$} 0.05) with inoculum density in both seasons. In 1989, the relationship between pod weight (y) and initial density (x) was described by Seinhorst's equation, with y = 0.088 + 0.91(0.90){$^($}x{$^{-1)}$} and r{$^2$} = 0.826. In 1990, the relationship was y = 0.22 + 0.78(0.97){$^($}x{$^{-1)}$} and r{$^2$} = 0.794.

   sustain crop yields. However modern agriculture is dependent on
   phosphorus derived from phosphate rock, which is a non-renewable

   While phosphorus demand is projected to increase, the expected global
   peak in phosphorus production is predicted to occur around 2030. The
   exact timing of peak phosphorus production might be disputed, however it
   is widely acknowledged within the fertilizer industry that the quality

   increasing. Yet future access to phosphorus receives little or no
   international attention. This paper puts forward the case for including
   long-term phosphorus scarcity on the priority agenda for global food

  abstract = {In evolutionary sense no resistance lasts forever. The durability of a resistance can be seen as a quantitative trait; resistances may range from not durable at all (ephemeral, or transient) to highly durable. Ephemeral resistance occurs against fungi and bacteria with a narrow host range, specialists. It is characterised by a hypersensitive reaction (HR), major gene inheritance and many resistance genes, which often occur in multiple allelic series and/or complex loci. These resistance genes (alleles) interact in a gene-for-gene way with avirulence genes (alleles) in the pathogen to give an incompatible reaction. The pathogen neutralises the effect of the resistance gene by a loss mutation in the corresponding avirulence allele. The incompatible reaction is not elicited any more and the pathogenicity is restored. The pathogens can afford the loss of many avirulences without loss of fitness. Durable resistance against specialised fungi and bacteria is often quantitative and based upon the additive effects of some to several genes, the resulting resistance being of another nature than the hypersensitive reaction. This quantitative resistance is present to nearly all pathogens at low to fair levels in most commercial cultivars. Durable resistance of a monogenic nature occurs too and is usually of a non-HR type. Resistance against fungi and bacteria with a wide host range, generalists, is usually quantitative and durable. Resistances against viruses are often fairly durable, even if these are based on monogenic, race-specific, HR resistances. The level of specialisation does not seem to be associated with the durability of resistance.},

  abstract = {There has been a vigorous and sometimes acerbic debate about the generality of the ``dilution effect'': the notion that biodiversity inhibits infectious disease, and conversely that loss of biodiversity increases disease risks to humans and livestock. In PNAS, Civitello et al. (1) report a meta-analysis of more than 200 individual effect sizes for 61 parasite species, and find strong support for the dilution effect. One of the key utilitarian arguments for preserving biodiversity is that it provides ``ecosystem services,'' services that are essential for human survival and well-being (2, 3). If the dilution effect is indeed a general phenomenon, it would be an important ecosystem service, with wide public policy implications.

The hypothesis that biological diversity limits infectious disease goes back to at least the middle of last century. In his classic paper on the epidemiology of malaria, MacDonald (4) suggested controlling malaria through ``zooprophylaxis,'' the provision of alternative hosts (such as cattle) that mosquito vectors prefer to bite over humans, thereby limiting transmission to humans. In a similar but more general vein, Elton (5) suggested that simple communities could be invaded more easily than complex communities. In an influential body of work, summarized in ref. 6, Ostfeld and Keesing have trenchantly argued that biodiversity is an effective buffer against infectious disease threats.

Much of Ostfeld and Keesing's (6, 7) work is based on a single, albeit important case study: Lyme disease in the northeast of the United States. Lyme disease in humans is a debilitating illness caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi , which is transmitted to humans via ticks, primarily the nymphal stage of Ixodes spp. (7).

  abstract = {A simulator for the enlargement of cohorts of circular lesions on cohorts of host tissue was used to examine five epidemiological parameters: radial rate (mm day(-1)) of lesion expansion, k(exp); maximum basic infection rate, R-m; proportion of lesion area as infectious, f; initial lesion size (mm(2)), z; and proportion of susceptible host sites, s. Based on the proportion of disease severity at day 50 and the proportion of the total disease that originated solely from lesion expansion, k(exp) was the most sensitive of the five parameters. A radial rate of only 0.1 mm day(-1) resulted in a proportion of {$>$}0.7 of the diseased area that came from lesion expansion. In an extensive survey of phytopathological literature, many plant pathogens had radial rates greater than 0.1 mm day(-1), which would result in a proportion of {$>$}0.95 of the total disease that comes from lesion expansion. Susceptible host sites, s, was a sensitive parameter, as this determined the host area into which lesions could expand. Naturally, R-m was a sensitive parameter for the proportion of disease on day 50, as it controlled the overall speed of the epidemic. Initial lesion size was a relatively insensitive parameter, although z interacted significantly with s. The greatest proportion of disease that originated from lesion expansion occurred with fast k(exp), small z, and low values of s, R-m, and f. The model was validated with lesion numbers and severities obtained in natural epidemics of Cercospora medicaginis on alfalfa and Exserohilum turcicum on maize. We recommend that the 'epidemic quintuplet' used to describe polycyclic epidemics be expanded to the 'epidemic sextuplet' with the inclusion of k(exp), since lesion expansion is a major component of many polycyclic epidemics.},

  abstract = {The multiplication of Soil-borne wheat mosaic virus (SBWMV) was studied in mixtures of two winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) cultivars, one susceptible (Soissons) and the other resistant (Tremie). Two seed mixtures of susceptible and resistant varieties in ratios of 1 : 1 and 1 : 3 and their component pure stands, i.e. each variety grown separately, were grown in a field infected with SBWMV. The presence of the virus was detected using DAS-ELISA from January to May. The resistant cultivar Tremie showed no foliar symptoms nor could the virus be detected in the leaves or roots. In May, about 88\% of plants of susceptible cultivar Soissons grown in pure stands were infected. At this time, the disease reduction relative to pure stands was 32.2\% in the 1 : 1 mixture and 39.8\% in the 1 : 3 mixture. Optical density (OD) values from ELISA of the infected plants in the two mixtures were consistently lower than that of the infected plants in cultivar Soissons in pure stands. The ELISA index (EI) calculated using three scales of OD values was 65.5\% in the susceptible cultivar in pure stands. The value for this index was 19.1\% in the 1 : 1 mixture and 7.9\% in the 1 : 3 mixture. The plants of the resistant cultivar Tremie infected in the same field and transferred in January to a growth cabinet at 15 degreesC multiplied the virus and produced viruliferous zoospores. These results show that the resistant cultivar Tremie plays a role in disease reduction in the cultivar mixtures in field conditions. Possible reasons for this are discussed.},

  abstract = {Plant-parasitic nematodes constrain chickpea (Cicer arietinum) production, with annual yield losses estimated to be 14\% of total global production. Nematode species causing significant economic damage in chickpea include root-knot nematodes (\emph{Meloidogyne} artiella, M. \emph{incognita}, M. javanica), cyst nematode (Heterodera ciceri), and root-lesion nematode (Pratylenchus thornei). Reduced functionality of roots from nematode infestation leads to water stress and nutrient deficiency, which in turn lead to poor plant growth and reduced yield. Integration of resistant crops with appropriate agronomic practices is recognized as the safest and most practical, economic and effective control strategy for plant-parasitic nematodes. However, breeding for resistance to plant-parasitic nematodes has numerous challenges that originate from the narrow genetic diversity of the C. arietinum cultigen. While levels of resistance to M. artiella, H. ciceri and P. thornei have been identified in wild Cicer species that are superior to resistance levels in the C. arietinum cultigen, barriers to interspecific hybridization restrict the use of these crop wild relatives, as sources of nematode resistance. Wild Cicer species of the primary genepool, C. reticulatum and C. echinospermum, are the only species that have been used to introgress resistance genes into the C. arietinum cultigen. The availability of genomic resources, including genome sequence and re-sequence information, the chickpea reference set and mini-core collections, and new wild Cicer collections, provide unprecedented opportunities for chickpea improvement. This review surveys progress in the identification of novel genetic sources of nematode resistance in international germplasm collections and recommends genome-assisted breeding strategies to accelerate introgression of nematode resistance into elite chickpea cultivars.},

The minimum relative yield and shoot weight was 0.16 and 0.3, respectively. The damage threshold was estimated of 1.8 eggs and juveniles g-1 soil by Seinhorst's model.

  abstract = {A comprehensive assessment of the impacts of climate change on agro-ecosystems over this century is developed, up to 2080 and at a global level, albeit with significant regional detail. To this end an integrated ecological\textendash{}economic modelling framework is employed, encompassing climate scenarios, agro-ecological zoning information, socio-economic drivers, as well as world food trade dynamics. Specifically, global simulations are performed using the FAO/IIASA agro-ecological zone model, in conjunction with IIASAs global food system model, using climate variables from five different general circulation models, under four different socio-economic scenarios from the intergovernmental panel on climate change. First, impacts of different scenarios of climate change on bio-physical soil and crop growth determinants of yield are evaluated on a 5{${'}\times$}5{${'}$} latitude/longitude global grid; second, the extent of potential agricultural land and related potential crop production is computed. The detailed bio-physical results are then fed into an economic analysis, to assess how climate impacts may interact with alternative development pathways, and key trends expected over this century for food demand and production, and trade, as well as key composite indices such as risk of hunger and malnutrition, are computed. This modelling approach connects the relevant bio-physical and socio-economic variables within a unified and coherent framework to produce a global assessment of food production and security under climate change. The results from the study suggest that critical impact asymmetries due to both climate and socio-economic structures may deepen current production and consumption gaps between developed and developing world; it is suggested that adaptation of agricultural techniques will be central to limit potential damages under climate change.},

Crop responses to climate warming suggest that yields will decrease as growing-season temperatures increase. Deutsch et al. show that this effect may be exacerbated by insect pests (see the Perspective by Riegler). Insects already consume 5 to 20\% of major grain crops. The authors' models show that for the three most important grain crops\textemdash{}wheat, rice, and maize\textemdash{}yield lost to insects will increase by 10 to 25\% per degree Celsius of warming, hitting hardest in the temperate zone. These findings provide an estimate of further potential climate impacts on global food supply and a benchmark for future regional and field-specific studies of crop-pest-climate interactions.
Science, this issue p. 916; see also p. 846
Insect pests substantially reduce yields of three staple grains\textemdash{}rice, maize, and wheat\textemdash{}but models assessing the agricultural impacts of global warming rarely consider crop losses to insects. We use established relationships between temperature and the population growth and metabolic rates of insects to estimate how and where climate warming will augment losses of rice, maize, and wheat to insects. Global yield losses of these grains are projected to increase by 10 to 25\% per degree of global mean surface warming. Crop losses will be most acute in areas where warming increases both population growth and metabolic rates of insects. These conditions are centered primarily in temperate regions, where most grain is produced.
Models of insect population growth and metabolism in a warming climate predict losses of major food crops to insect pests.

Despite fears to the contrary, in recent years we have seen continued progress toward better methods of feeding humanity. Sub-Saharan Africa is the sole major exception. Looking to the future, this paper argues that the continuation of recent cereal yield trends should be sufficient to cope with most of the demographically driven expansion of cereal demand that will occur until the year 2025. However, because of an increasing degree of mismatch between the expansion of regional demand and the potential for supply, there will be a major expansion of world cereal (and noncereal food) trade. Other consequences for global agriculture arising from demographic growth include the need to use water much more efficiently and an even greater dependence on nitrogen fertilizers (e.g., South Asia). Farming everywhere will depend more on information-intensive agricultural management procedures. Moreover, despite continued general progress, there still will be a significant number of undernourished people in 2025. Signs of heightened harvest variability, especially in North America, are of serious concern. Thus, although future general food trends are likely to be positive, in some respects we also could be entering a more volatile world.},

  abstract = {A vast number of plant pathogens from viroids of a few hundred nucleotides to higher plants cause diseases in our crops. Their effects range from mild symptoms to catastrophes in which large areas planted to food crops are destroyed. Catastrophic plant disease exacerbates the current deficit of food supply in which at least 800 million people are inadequately fed. Plant pathogens are difficult to control because their populations are variable in time, space, and genotype. Most insidiously, they evolve, often overcoming the resistance that may have been the hard-won achievement of the plant breeder. In order to combat the losses they cause, it is necessary to define the problem and seek remedies. At the biological level, the requirements are for the speedy and accurate identification of the causal organism, accurate estimates of the severity of disease and its effect on yield, and identification of its virulence mechanisms. Disease may then be minimized by the reduction of the pathogen's inoculum, inhibition of its virulence mechanisms, and promotion of genetic diversity in the crop. Conventional plant breeding for resistance has an important role to play that can now be facilitated by marker-assisted selection. There is also a role for transgenic modification with genes that confer resistance. At the political level, there is a need to acknowledge that plant diseases threaten our food supplies and to devote adequate resources to their control.},

The new and old population types are characterized by unique allozyme alleles and genotypes. The mechanism for displacement of the`old'by the`new'population is not yet known.},

  abstract = {There is a trend world-wide to grow crops in short rotation or in monoculture, particularly in conventional agriculture. This practice is becoming more prevalent due to a range of factors including economic market trends, technological advances, government incentives, and retailer and consumer demands. Land-use intensity will have to increase further in future in order to meet the demands of growing crops for both bioenergy and food production, and long rotations may not be considered viable or practical. However, evidence indicates that crops grown in short rotations or monoculture often suffer from yield decline compared to those grown in longer rotations or for the first time. Numerous factors have been hypothesised as contributing to yield decline, including biotic factors such as plant pathogens, deleterious rhizosphere microorganisms, mycorrhizas acting as pathogens, and allelopathy or autotoxicity of the crop, as well as abiotic factors such as land management practices and nutrient availability. In many cases, soil microorganisms have been implicated either directly or indirectly in yield decline. Although individual factors may be responsible for yield decline in some cases, it is more likely that combinations of factors interact to cause the problem. However, evidence confirming the precise role of these various factors is often lacking in field studies due to the complex nature of cropping systems and the numerous interactions that take place within them. Despite long-term knowledge of the yield-decline phenomenon, there are few tools to counteract it apart from reverting to longer crop rotations or break crops. Alternative cropping and management practices such as double-cropping or inter-cropping, tillage and organic amendments may prove valuable for combating some of the negative effects seen when crops are grown in short rotation. Plant breeding continues to be important, although this does require a specific breeding target to be identified. This review identifies gaps in our understanding of yield decline, particularly with respect to the complex interactions occurring between the different components of agro-ecosystems, which may well influence food security in the 21st Century.},

Plants have evolved other receptors (R proteins) that detect these pathogen effectors and activate strong defenses. Pathogens can subsequently alter or delete their recognized effectors to avoid defense elicitation, at risk of a fitness cost associated with loss of those effectors. Significant research progress is revealing, among other things, mechanisms of MAMP perception, the host defense processes and specific host proteins that pathogen effectors target, the mechanisms of R protein activation, and the ways in which pathogen effector suites and R genes evolve. These findings carry practical ramifications for resistance durability and for future resistance engineering. The present review uses numerous questions to help clarify what we know and to identify areas that are ripe for further investigation.},

The directed delivery of microbial molecules into and around the host cell, and the subsequent perception of these by the invaded plant tissue (or lack thereof), determines the difference between disease and disease resistance. In theory, any foreign molecule produced by an invading pathogen could act as an elicitor of the broad physiological and transcriptional re-programming indicative of a plant defense response. The diversity of elicitors recognized by plants seems to support this hypothesis. Additionally, these elicitors are often virulence factors from the pathogen recognized by the host. This recognition, though genetically as simple as a ligand-receptor interaction, may require additional host proteins that are the nominal targets of virulence factor action. Transduction of recognition probably requires regulated protein degradation and results in massive changes in cellular homeostasis, including a programmed cell death known as the hypersensitive response that indicates a successful, if perhaps over-zealous, disease resistance response.},

  abstract = {Many race-specific resistance genes to potato late blight are overcome in France, but the disease appears later on genotypes carrying the R2 gene. This study examined whether R2 could contribute to durable late-blight control in France, and analysed the conditions of its performance. Plants grown from tubers of different physiological ages showed no difference in R2 expression in field and climate-chamber experiments, demonstrating that the delay in epidemic onset provided by R2 was not the result of gene inactivation in old plants. Among isolates collected at one site, those virulent on R2 were classified into three AFLP profiles. AFLP-VII comprised exclusively isolates virulent to R2, whereas AFLP-IV and AFLP-V included both virulent and avirulent isolates. No significant aggressiveness differences were observed between virulent and avirulent isolates from AFLP-V; however, isolates from AFLP-VII were significantly less aggressive than virulent isolates from AFLP-V. These results indicate that: (i) the delayed onset of epidemics on R2 cultivars is the result of the breakdown of R2 by virulent isolates; (ii) aggressiveness of isolates virulent to R2 depends primarily on the genetic background of the pathogen where the mutation to virulence occurs; and (iii) this mutation does not lead per se to lower pathogenic fitness. It is suggested that R2 is unlikely to make a lasting contribution to late-blight control in France, and that diversification strategies such as cultivar mixtures might not considerably increase its durability.},

  shorttitle = {The Integrated Concept of Disease Resistance},
  abstract = {SummaryHorizontal, uniform, race-non-specific or stable resistance can be discerned according to Van der Plank, from vertical, differential, race-specific or unstable resistance by a test in which a number of host genotypes (cultivars or clones) are tested against a number of pathogen genetypes traces of isolatest. If the total non-environmental variance in levels of resistance is due to main effects only differences between cultivars and differences between isolates) the resistance and the pathogen many (in the broad sense) are horizontal in nature. Vertical resistance and pathogenicity are characterized by the interaction between host and pathogen showing up as a variance compenent in this test due to interaction between cultivars and isolates.A host and pathogen model was made in which resistance and pathogenicity are governed by live polygenic loci. Within the host the resistance genes show additivity. Two models were investigated in model I resistance and pathogenicity genes operate in an additive way as envisaged by Van der Plank in his horizontal resistance. Model II is characterized by a gene-for-gene action between the polygenes of the host and those of the pathogen.The cultivar isolate test in model I showed only main effect variance. Surprisingly, the variance in model II was also largely due to main effects. The contribution of the interaction to the variance uppeared so small, that it would be difficult to discern it from a normal error variance.So-called horizontal resistance can therefore be explained by a polygenic resistance, where the individual genes are vertical and operating on a gene-for-gene basis with virulence genes in the pathogen. The data reported so far support the idea that model II rather than model I is the realistic one.The two models also revealed that populations with a polygenic resistance based on the gene-for-gene action have an increased level of resistance compared with the addition model, while its stability as far as mutability of the pathogen is concerned, is higher compared to those with an additive gene action. Mathematical studies of Mode too support the gene-for-gene concept.The operation of all resistance and virulence genes in a natural population is therefore seen as one integrated system. All genes for true resistance in the host population, whether they are major or minor genes are considered to interact in a gene-for-gene way with virulence genes either major or minor, in the pathogen population.The models revealed other important aspects. Populations with a polygenic resistance based on a gene-for-gene action have an increased level of resistance compared to populations following the addition model. The stability, as far as mutability of the pathogen is concerned, is higher in the interaction model than in the addition model.The effect of a resistance gene on the level of resistance of the population consists of its effect on a single plant times its gene frequency in the population. Due to the adaptive forces in both the host and the pathogen population and the gene-for-gene nature of the gene action an equilibrium develops that allows all resistance genes to remain effective although their corresponding virulence genes are present. The frequencies of the resistance and virulence genes are such that the effective frequencies of resistance genes tend to be negatively related to the magnitude of the gene effect. This explains why major genes often occur at low frequencies, while minor genes appear to be frequent. It is in this way that the host and the pathogen, both as extremely variable and vigorous populations, can co-exist.Horizontal and vertical resistance as meant by Van der Plank therefore do not represent different kinds of resistances, they represent merely polygenic and oligogenic resistances resp. In both situations the individual host genes interact specifically with virulence genes in the pathogen. Van der Plank's test for horizontal resistance appears to be a simple and sound way to test for polygenic inheritance of resistance.The practical considerations have been discussed. The agro-ecosystems should be made as diverse as possible. Multilines, polygenic resistance, tolerance, gene deployment and other measures should be employed, if possible in combination.},

  abstract = {Cultivated and wild potatoes contain a major disease-resistance cluster on the short arm of chromosome V, including the R1 resistance (R) gene against potato late blight. To explore the functional and evolutionary significance of clustering in the generation of novel disease-resistance genes, we constructed three approximately 1 Mb physical maps in the R1 gene region, one for each of the three genomes (haplotypes) of allohexaploid Solanum demissum, the wild potato progenitor of the R1 locus. Totals of 691, 919 and 559 kb were sequenced for each haplotype, and three distinct resistance-gene families were identified, one homologous to the potato R1 gene and two others homologous to either the Prf or the Bs4 R-gene of tomato. The regions with R1 homologues are highly divergent among the three haplotypes, in contrast to the conserved flanking non-resistance gene regions. The R1 locus shows dramatic variation in overall length and R1 homologue number among the three haplotypes. Sequence comparisons of the R1 homologues show that they form three distinct clades in a distance tree. Frequent sequence exchanges were detected among R1 homologues within each clade, but not among those in different clades. These frequent sequence exchanges homogenized the intron sequences of homologues within each clade, but did not homogenize the coding sequences. Our results suggest that the R1 homologues represent three independent groups of fast-evolving type I resistance genes, characterized by chimeric structures resulting from frequent sequence exchanges among group members. Such genes were first identified among clustered RGC2 genes in lettuce, where they were distinguished from slow-evolving type II R-genes. Our findings at the R1 locus in S. demissum may indicate that a common or similar mechanism underlies the previously reported differentiation of type I and type II R-genes and the differentiation of type I R-genes into distinct groups, identified here.},

Using the pepper (Capsicum annuum)/Potato virus Y (PVY, genus Potyvirus) pathosystem, we aimed at identifying plant genetic factors directly affecting the frequency of virus adaptation to the major resistance gene pvr23 and at comparing them with genetic factors affecting quantitative resistance. The resistance breakdown frequency was a highly heritable trait (h2=0.87). Four loci including additive quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and epistatic interactions explained together 70\% of the variance of pvr23 breakdown frequency. Three of the four QTLs controlling pvr23 breakdown frequency were also involved in quantitative resistance, strongly suggesting that QTLs controlling quantitative resistance have a pleiotropic effect on the durability of the major resistance gene. With the first mapping of QTLs directly affecting resistance durability, this study provides a rationale for sustainable resistance breeding. Surprisingly, a genetic trade-off was observed between the durability of PVY resistance controlled by pvr23 and the spectrum of the resistance against different potyviruses. This trade-off seemed to have been resolved by the combination of minor-effect durability QTLs under long-term farmer selection.},

Measuring such costs experimentally has proven difficult, especially in pathogens not readily amenable to genetic transformation, since the creation of isogenic lines differing only by the presence or absence of avirulence genes cannot be achieved in many organisms. Here, we circumvented this difficulty by comparing fitness traits in groups of Phytophthora infestans isolates sharing the same multilocus fingerprint, but differing by their virulence/avirulence spectrum.},

We tested general vs. local population adaptation to host cultivars, by characterizing a French collection of Phytophthora infestans (the causal organism of potato late blight) sampled during two consecutive years on cultivars exhibiting various levels of resistance. Local populations were structured by the host for virulence (qualitative pathogenicity) but also for aggressiveness (quantitative pathogenicity). All populations had a low genotypic diversity for amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), and presumably consisted of a few closely related clonal lineages. No correlation was detected between pathogenicity traits and AFLP genotypes. The data support the hypothesis of general adaptation for aggressiveness, to which directional selection for virulence is superimposed when race-specific resistance is introduced.},

  abstract = {Leptosphaeria maculans is the most ubiquitous pathogen of Brassica crops, and mainly oilseed brassicas (oilseed rape, canola), causing the devastating `stem canker' or `blackleg'. This review summarizes our current knowledge on the pathogen, from taxonomic issues to specific life traits. It mainly illustrates the importance of formal genetics approaches on the pathogen side to dissect the interaction with the host plants. In addition, this review presents the main current research topics on L. maculans and focuses on the L. maculans genome initiative recently begun, including its main research issues. Taxonomy: Leptosphaeria maculans (Desm.) Ces. \& de Not. (anamorph Phoma lingam Tode ex Fr.). Kingdom Fungi, Phylum Ascomycota, Class Dothideomycetes (Loculoascomycetes), Order Pleosporales, Genus Leptosphaeria, Species maculans. Host range: cultivated Brassicas such as Brassica napus (oilseed rape, canola), B. rapa, B. juncea, B. oleracea, etc., along with numerous wild crucifers species. Arabidopsis thaliana was recently reported to be a potential host for L. maculans. Primary disease symptoms are greyish-green collapse of cotyledon or leaf tissue, without a visible margin, bearing tiny black spots (pycnidia). The fungus then develops an endophytic symptomless growth for many months. Secondary symptoms, at the end of the growing season, are dry necroses of the crown tissues with occasional blackening (stem canker or blackleg) causing lodging of the plants. Pseudothecia differentiate on leftover residues. Seedling damping-off and premature ripening are also reported under certain environmental conditions.

The 28 well-expressed effector genes in the repertoire of the model pathogen P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 were deleted to produce polymutant DC3000D28E. Growth of DC3000D28E in Nicotiana benthamiana was symptomless and 4 logs lower than that of DC3000{$\Delta$}hopQ1-1, which causes disease in this model plant. DC3000D28E seemed functionally effectorless but otherwise WT in diagnostic phenotypes relevant to plant interactions (for example, ability to inject the AvrPto-Cya reporter into N. benthamiana). Various effector genes were integrated by homologous recombination into native loci or by a programmable or random in vivo assembly shuttle (PRIVAS) system into the exchangeable effector locus in the Hrp pathogenicity island of DC3000D28E. The latter method exploited dual adapters and recombination in yeast for efficient assembly of PCR products into programmed or random combinations of multiple effector genes. Native and PRIVAS-mediated integrations were combined to identify a minimal functional repertoire of eight effector genes that restored much of the virulence of DC3000{$\Delta$}hopQ1-1 in N. benthamiana, revealing a hierarchy in effector function: AvrPtoB acts with priority in suppressing immunity, enabling other effectors to promote further growth (HopM1 and HopE1), chlorosis (HopG1), lesion formation (HopAM1-1), and near full growth and symptom production (AvrE, HopAA1-1, and/or HopN1 functioning synergistically with the previous effectors). DC3000D28E, the PRIVAS method, and minimal functional repertoires provide new resources for probing the plant immune system.},

Presently, durable resistances are only identified after a long period of large-scale cultivation of resistant cultivars. We propose a new predictor of the durability of plant resistance. Because resistance breakdown involves modifications in the avirulence factors of pathogens, we tested for correlations between the evolutionary constraints acting on avirulence factors or their diversity and the durability of the corresponding resistance genes in the case of plant\textendash{}virus interactions. An analysis performed on 20 virus species\textendash{}resistance gene combinations revealed that the selective constraints applied on amino acid substitutions in virus avirulence factors correlate with the observed durability of the corresponding resistance genes. On the basis of this result, a model predicting the potential durability of resistance genes as a function of the selective constraints applied on the corresponding avirulence factors is proposed to help breeders to select the most durable resistance genes.},

By contrast, the resistance was still effective after 5 yr of selection by the genotype combining this gene with quantitative resistance. No significant variation in the performance of quantitative resistance alone was noted over the course of the experiment. \textbullet{} We conclude that quantitative resistance can increase the durability of Rlm6.

By extracting invasion and persistence thresholds of host, pathogen and biological control agent, performing an equilibrium analysis, and numerical investigation of sensitivity to parameters and initial conditions, we determine criteria for successful biological control. We identify conditions for biological control (i) to prevent a pathogen entering a system, (ii) to eradicate a pathogen that is already present and, if that is not possible, (iii) to reduce the density of the pathogen. Control depends upon the epidemiology of the pathogen and how efficiently the antagonist can colonise particular habitats (i.e. healthy tissue, infected tissue and/or soil-borne inoculum). A sharp transition between totally effective control (i.e. eradication of the pathogen) and totally ineffective control can follow slight changes in biologically interpretable parameters or to the initial amounts of pathogen and biological control agent present. Effective biological control requires careful matching of antagonists to pathosystems. For preventative/eradicative control, antagonists must colonise susceptible hosts. However, for reduction in disease prevalence, the range of habitat is less important than the antagonist's bulking-up efficiency.},

Specifically, we quantify the effect of the antagonistic fungus, Trichoderma viride, Pets ex. Gray, on the pathozone dynamics of the damping-off fungus, Rhizoctonia solani Kuhn on radish. The results from these individual-based experiments are used to predict the progress of an epidemic and the results are compared with experimental epidemics in microcosms. The addition of T. viride close to a germinating radish plant reduced the extent of the pathozone influence from 22.6 to 13.8 mm. Trichoderma viride also inhibited the evolution of infection efficiency of R. solani. The evolution of infection efficiency over time is described by a simple non-linear model for the probability of infection with distance, in which certain of the parameters vary with time. By combining this with a model based on conditional probabilities for the location and infectivity of randomly dispersed propagules within the pathozone, we were able to scale up and predict the disease progress of R. solani in a population of radish plants, and the extent of control effected by T. viride. Disease progress rose progressively tO a maximum of 42 \% diseased plants in the unprotected crop compared with a sigmoidal approach to 13\% in the protected crop. We show that these properties are consistent with a monomolecular function for primary infection with a temporally-varying rate parameter. We also show that the central region of the pathozone, where the joint probabilities of occurrence of a randomly located propagule and its ability to infect are maximal, has a large influence on the sensitivity of epidemics to pathozone dynamics. This is an important example of interpreting population behaviour of an epidemic from the infection and disease of single plants.},

Here, I present a general theoretical framework for the study of life-history evolution of multihost parasites. This analysis highlights the importance of epidemiology (the relative quality and quantity of different types of infected hosts) and between-trait constraints (both within and between different hosts) to parasite evolution. I illustrate these effects in different transmission scenarios under the simplifying assumption that parasites can infect only two types of hosts. These simple but contrasted evolutionary scenarios yield new insights into virulence evolution and the evolution of transmission routes among different hosts. Because many of the pathogens that have large public-health and agricultural impacts have complex life cycles, an understanding of their evolutionary dynamics could hold substantial benefits for management.},

The appearance of a separate identity for epidemiological modeling of soilborne pathogens is reinforced by the inflow of ideas from nematology (Barker and Noe, 1988), from mycorrhizal system (Harley and Smith, 1983) and from morphological and physiological concepts for root growth (Bowen and Rovira, 1976; Huisman, 1982). But the distinction is not rigid. Undoubtedly, many of the standard analytical techniques and models of plant disease epidemiology, discussed elsewhere in this volume, are equally applicable to subterranean as to aerial systems. Similarly, concepts such as inoculum potential, which were developed principally for edaphic systems (Garett, 1970), can also be applied to pathogens above ground (Bashi et al., 1982).},

  abstract = {In this paper we study the dynamical properties of models for botanical epidemics, especially for soil-borne fungal infection. The models develop several new concepts, involving dual sources of infection, host and inoculum dynamics. Epidemics are modelled with respect to the infection status of whole plants and plant organs (the G model) or to lesion density and size (the SW model). The infection can originate in two sources, either from the initial inoculum (primary infection) or by a direct transmission between plant tissue (secondary infection). The first term corresponds to the transmission through the free-living stages of macroparasites or an external source of infection in certain medical models, whereas the second term is equivalent to direct transmission between the hosts in microparasitic infections. The models allow for dynamics of host growth and inoculum decay. We show that the two models for root and lesion dynamics can be derived as special cases of a single generic model. Analytical and numerical methods are used to analyse the behaviour of the models for static, unlimited (exponential) and asymptotically limited host growth with and without secondary infection, and with and without decay of initial inoculum. The models are shown to exhibit a range of epidemic behaviour within single seasons that extends from simple monotonic increase with saturation of the host population, through temporary plateaux as the system switches from primary to secondary infection, to effective elimination of the pathogen by the host outgrowing the fungal infection. For certain conditions, the equilibrium values are shown to depend on initial conditions. These results have important consequences for the control of plant disease. They can be applied beyond soil-borne plant pathogens to mycorrhizal fungi and aerial pathogens while the principles of primary and secondary infection with host and inoculum dynamics may be used to link classical models for both microparasitic and macroparasitic infections.},

An overarching modeling framework is then presented that can be used to analyze disease invasion and persistence at a range of scales from the microscopic to the regional. Criteria for invasion and persistence are introduced, initially for simple models of epidemics, and then for models with greater biological realism. Some ways in which epidemiological models are used to identify optimal strategies for the control of disease are discussed. Particular attention is given to the spatial structure of host populations and to the role of chance events in determining invasion and persistence of plant pathogens. Finally, three brief case studies are used to illustrate the practical applications of epidemiological theory to understand invasion and persistence of plant pathogens. These comprise long-term predictions for the persistence and control of Dutch elm disease; identification of methods to manage the spread of rhizomania on sugar beet in the U.K. by matching the scale of control with the spatial and temporal scales of the disease; and analysis of evolutionary change in virus control to identify risks of inadvertent selection for damaging virus strains.},

Co-occlusion is the incorporation of wild-type and mutant viruses in the same occlusion body as a strategy to deliver genetically modified viruses as an insecticide in a way that minimizes their persistence in the environment. The model predicts that the persistence of the modified virus depends most critically on the number of viruses that infect an occlusion body-producing nucleus, the number of occlusion bodies typically ingested by an insect, and the number of viruses that cross the gut wall. FP viruses occur at high frequency in cell culture where they have a replication advantage over wild-type virus. They cannot, however, produce viable occlusion bodies, but it is shown that under certain circumstances they can persist in natural populations as parasites of wild-type viruses. FP viruses have not as yet been identified in natural NPV populations, and possible reasons for this are discussed. We suggest that the models developed here can also help in studying potential recombination between engineered and wild-type viruses in the environment.},

  abstract = {Most ecological and epidemiological models describe systems with continuous uninterrupted interactions between populations. Many systems, though, have ecological disturbances, such as those associated with planting and harvesting of a seasonal crop. In this paper, we introduce host-parasite-hyperparasite systems as models of biological control in a disturbed environment, where the host-parasite interactions are discontinuous. One model is a parasite-hyperparasite system designed to capture the essence of biological control and the other is a host-parasite-hyperparasite system that incorporates many more features of the population dynamics. Two types of discontinuity are included in the models. One corresponds to a pulse of new parasites at harvest and the other reflects the discontinuous presence of the host due to planting and harvesting. Such discontinuities are characteristic of many ecosystems involving parasitism or other interactions with an annual host. The models are tested against data from an experiment, investigating the persistent biological control of the fungal plant parasite of lettuce Sclerotinia minor by the fungal hyperparasite Sporidesmium sclerotivorum, over successive crops. Using a combination of mathematical analysis, model fitting and parameter estimation, the factors that contribute the observed persistence of the parasite are examined. Analytical results show that repeated planting and harvesting of the host allows the parasite to persist by maintaining a quantity of host tissue in the system on which the parasite can reproduce. When the host dynamics are not included explicitly in the model, we demonstrate that homogeneous mixing fails to predict the persistence of the parasite population, while incorporating spatial heterogeneity by allowing for heterogeneous mixing prevents fade-out. Including the host dynamics lessens the effect of heterogeneous mixing on persistence, though the predicted values for the parasite population are closer to the observed values. An alternative hypothesis for persistence involving a stepped change in rates of infection is also tested and model fitting is used to show that changes in some environmental conditions may contribute to parasite persistence. The importance of disturbances and periodic forcing in models for interacting populations is discussed.},

The theory is developed for a generic model that takes into account two features characteristic of plant-parasite interactions: a dual source of inoculum (infection from primary or externally introduced inoculum and secondary infection from contact between susceptible and infected host tissue) and a host response to infection lead. Each of the threshold criteria is shown to be the sum of the individual components for primary and secondary infection. This indicates that if parasite invasion is not possible through primary or secondary infection alone, when the two modes of transmission are combined, the parasite may be able to invade. The invasion criteria demonstrate that there is a threshold population of susceptible hosts below which the parasite is unable to invade. If there are nonlinearities in the population dynamics (arising through either the transmission process or the host response), there are also threshold densities for the infected hosts and parasite populations below which invasion does not occur. The implications of the results for the control of plant disease are discussed. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

If the product of root density and inoculum density is constant, then a monomolecular curve (without an inflexion point) results. When the product is a function of time, then either an asymptotic exponential or a sigmoid curve results, depending upon the parameter values. Where the product of root density and inoculum density increases exponentially, then a Gompertz function in the incidence of surviving plants results. Where root growth is fast relative to the reduction in inoculum through infection, then an asymptotic value of disease less than 1.0 is predicted. Detailed models of dynamics of root infection, incorporating root extension and loss of inoculum due to infection, and cases without and with lesion expansion, lead to the following conclusions: (1) increase in lesion numbers without lesion expansion, does not constrain or provide an upper limit to root growth; (2) where there is no root growth, then the proportion of root surface covered by lesions approaches an asymptote strictly less than 1.0 in the case without lesion expansion, but approaches 1.0 in the case with lesion expansion; (3) where the rate of infection is greater than the rate of root extension (without lesion expansion), then there is an upper limit to lesion surface area on roots; otherwise both root surface area and lesion numbers increase without limit; (4) where the rate of lesion expansion is greater than the rate of root extension, then the proportion of root surface area covered by lesions approaches 1.0 asymptotically. Explicit solutions giving the healthy root area as a function of time are obtained. Analysis of the dynamics of root infection indicates that root disease control strategies should aim to reduce pathogen density, maintain a low rate of root extension relative to root infection and restrict lesion expansion.},

Temporal development of damping-off disease of radish seedlings caused by an economically important plant pathogen, Rhizoctonia solani, is quantified, with and without the addition of an antagonistic fungus, Trichoderma viride. The biological control agent reduces the average amount of disease but also greatly enhances the variability among replicates. The results are shown to be consistent with predictions from a nonlinear model that exhibits dynamically generated variability in which small differences in the initiation of infection associated with the antagonist are later amplified as the pathogen spreads from plant to plant. The effect of dynamically generated variability is mediated by the interruption of transient disease progress curves for separate replicates by an exponential decrease in susceptibility of the host over time. The decay term essentially 'freezes' the dynamics of the transient behaviour so that the solutions for different replicates settle on asymptotes that depend on initial conditions and parameter values. The effect is further magnified by nonlinear terms in the infection force in the models. A generalization of the Lyapunov exponent is introduced to quantify the amplification. The observed behaviour has profound consequences for the design and interpretation of ecological experiments, and can also account for the notorious failure of many biological control strategies through the creation of 'hot spots', created by the amplification of plant to plant infection, where the control by the antagonist is locally unsuccessful.},

We compare the effects of using two commonly used formulations for host growth, one linear and the other nonlinear, upon the outcomes for invasion, persistence and control of pathogens in a widely used, generic model for botanical epidemics. The criterion for invasion, reflected in the basic reproductive number, R0, is unaffected by host demography: R0 is simply a function of epidemiological parameters alone. When, however, host growth is intrinsically nonlinear, unexpected results arise for persistence and the control of disease. The endemic level of infection (I{$\infty$}) also depends upon R0. We show, however, that the sensitivity of I{$\infty$} to changes in R0 {$>$} 1 depends upon which underlying epidemiological parameter is changed. Increasing R0 by shortening the infectious period results in a monotonic increase in I{$\infty$}. If, however, an increase in R0 is driven by increases in transmission rates or by decreases in the decay of free-living inoculum, I{$\infty$} first increases (R0 {$<$} 2), but then decreases (R0 {$>$} 2). This counterintuitive result means that increasing the intensity of control can result in more endemic infection.},

abstract = {Abstract The activation of plant defence to restrict pathogen invasion is often conferred by resistance (R) proteins. The most prevalent class of R proteins contain leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), a central nucleotide binding site and a variable amino terminal domain. Other classes possess an extracellular LRR domain, a transmembrane domain and sometimes an intracellular serine/threonine kinase domain. R proteins function in pathogen perception and/or the activation of conserved defence signalling networks. Upon infection, specific effectors produced by pathogens and presumed to promote growth in host tissue, are either directly recognized by different R proteins or are recognized by a targeted plant protein which is itself guarded by R proteins. Subsequently, various defence signalling networks are activated via R protein phosphorylation, oligomerization, degradation, conformational changes and by the shuttling of R proteins between the plant cell cytoplasm and the nucleus. The overall outcome is dramatic cellular reprogramming and the activation of coordinated defence responses both locally at the site of infection as well as systemically throughout the plant. Many R gene loci appear to be under positive genetic selection, which rapidly diversifies paralogous sequences. Some R genes are present in plant genomes at single loci as either a single sequence or an allelic series whilst others reside within tight or loose clusters of related R sequences. For a century, plant breeders have genetically characterized and used R genes to reduce the impact of pathogens on crop production. More recently, various transgenic approaches have been tested to provide broader spectrum control and improved durability.}

However, the molecular mechanisms that control QDR remain poorly understood, largely due to the incomplete and inconsistent nature of the resistance phenotype, which is usually conditioned by many loci of small effect. Here, we discuss recent advances in research on QDR. Based on inferences from analyses of the defense response and from the few isolated QDR genes, we suggest several plausible hypotheses for a range of mechanisms underlying QDR. We propose that a new generation of genetic resources, complemented by careful phenotypic analysis, will produce a deeper understanding of plant defense and more effective utilization of natural resistance alleles.},

A genetic linkage map of this population was constructed in parallel using PCR-based SSR, AFLP and CAPS markers. Analysis of the trait scores alongside the marker segregation data allowed the identification of regions of the genome which were significantly correlated with components of the respective characters. The most significant associations for all four traits were with marker alleles on potato linkage group V originating from the male (susceptible) parent. In the case of foliage resistance to late blight, the positions of the majority of the effects, which were located on eleven of the twelve potato linkage groups, have been detected in previous [16] and parallel studies [21]. The absence of Solanum demissum-derived R genes for hypersensitive response to late blight and the co-localisation of QTL for resistance, vigour and earliness suggest that developmental and/or physiological factors play a major role in determining the level of foliage resistance in this population. In contrast with previous findings, a negative correlation was found between foliage and tuber blight resistance.},

Endogenous elicitors are similarly recognized as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). This review focuses on the diversity of MAMPs/DAMPs and on progress to identify the corresponding pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in plants. The two best-characterized MAMP/PRR pairs, flagellin/FLS2 and EF-Tu/EFR, are discussed in detail and put into a phylogenetic perspective. Both FLS2 and EFR are leucine-rich repeat receptor kinases (LRR-RKs). Upon treatment with flagellin, FLS2 forms a heteromeric complex with BAK1, an LRR-RK that also acts as coreceptor for the brassinolide receptor BRI1. The importance of MAMP/PRR signaling for plant immunity is highlighted by the finding that plant pathogens use effectors to inhibit PRR complexes or downstream signaling events. Current evidence indicates that MAMPs, DAMPs, and effectors are all perceived as danger signals and induce a stereotypic defense response.},

The level of virulence that maximizes the parasite's fitness (Multhusian parameter) increases with increasing longevity of its propagules only if the host-parasite system has not reached equilibrium and the death rate of the propagules is high relative to that of the infected hosts. Therefore, for parasites that have recently invaded a susceptible host population, greater propagule longevity may initially favour higher virulence; but once the equilibrium is reached the optimal virulence is independent of propagule longevity.},

  abstract = {We show how directly transmitted microparasites, broadly defined to include viruses, bacteria, protozoans and fungi, may regulate natural populations of invertebrate hosts. The study combines elements of conventional epidemiology (where the host population is assumed constant) with elements of prey-predator studies (which conventionally emphasize how prey and predator populations may be regulated by their interaction). To this end, we construct simple models embodying the essentials of the dynamical interaction between invertebrate hosts and their directly transmitted microparasites. In successive refinements, these models include the effects of recovery and disease-induced mortality, castration or diminished reproduction of infected hosts, vertical transmission, latent periods of infection, stress-related pathogenicity, the interplay between disease and other density-dependent constraints on host population growth, and free-living infective stages. In analysing the dynamical behaviour of these models, we focus on : the possible regulation of the host population by the parasite; the basic reproductive rate of the parasite, and the way in which it affects the dynamics and the evolution of the host-parasite association; and the threshold host density and its implications for endemic or epidemic maintenance of the infection. These are examined in the light of synoptic compilations of field and laboratory data on: birth rates (and disease-induced reduction thereof), natural death rates and disease-induced death rates of hosts; latent periods and efficiencies of vertical transmission of pathogens; the rate of production and lifetime of free-living infective stages; and some characteristics of long-term cycles and of epidemic outbreaks of disease in forest insects. In particular, our models suggest that the baculovirus and microsporidian infections of many temperate forest insects will tend to produce stable cycles in host abundance and in prevalence of infection, with periods in the range 5-12 years. Enough is known about the European larch budmoth and an associated granulosis virus for us to undertake a detailed comparison between theory and data that strongly suggests that the observed 9-10 year cycles are driven by the host-parasite interaction. We also discuss the possible control of invertebrate pest species by pathogens, showing how our models could guide laboratory or field studies, to help estimate whether a given pathogen is capable of regulating the target pest population, and, if so, roughly what quantity is needed to effect a specific level of (local) control. Throughout, the emphasis is on the biological ingredients of the models, and on the biological conclusions to be drawn; mathematical details are given in appendixes.},

Transmission rates were defined within a compartmental S\textendash{}I (susceptible\textendash{}infected) model for plant epidemics and estimated empirically using counts from spatial maps.

The partial resistance to the rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe grisea) in Chubu 32 has isolate specificity; isolate IBOS8-1-1 is more aggressive on Chubu 32 than are other isolates. We hypothesized that the gene-for-gene relationship fits this case of a partial resistance gene in Chubu 32 against the avirulence gene in the pathogen. The partial resistance gene in Chubu 32 was mapped between DNA markers C1172 (and three other co-segregated markers) and E2021 and was designated Pi34. In the 32 F3 lines from the cross between a chromosome segment substitution line (Pi34-) from Koshihikari/Kasalath and Chubu 32, the lines with high levels of partial resistance to the M. grisea isolate Y93-245c-2 corresponded to the presence of Pi34 estimated by graphic genotyping. This indicated that Pi34 has partial resistance to isolate Y93-245c-2 in compatible interactions. The 69 blast isolates from the F1 progeny produced by the cross between Y93-245c-2 and IBOS8-1-1 were tested for aggressiveness on Chubu 32 and rice cultivar Koshihikari (Pi34-). The progeny segregated at a 1\,:\,1 ratio for strong to weak aggressiveness on Chubu 32. The results suggested that Y93-245c-2 has one gene encoding avirulence to Pi34 (AVRPi34), and IBOS8-1-1 is extremely aggressive on Chubu 32 because of the absence of AVRPi34. This is the first report of a gene-for-gene relationship between a fungal disease resistance gene associated with severity of disease and pathogen aggressiveness.},

Wild-type Pi21 appears to slow the plant's defense responses, which may support optimization of defense mechanisms. Deletions in its proline-rich motif inhibit this slowing. Pi21 is separable from a closely linked gene conferring poor flavor. The resistant pi21 allele, which is found in some strains of japonica rice, could improve blast resistance of rice worldwide.},

Two dominant loci associated with qualitative resistance to five isolates of the fungus were tentatively named Pi-5(t) and Pi-7(t). They were mapped on chromosomes 4 and 11, respectively. To identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting partial resistance, RI lines were inoculated with isolate PO6-6 of Pyricularia oryzae in polycyclic tests. Ten chromosomal segments were found to be associated with effects on lesion number (P {$<$} 0.0001 and LOD {$>$} 6.0). Three of the markers associated with QTLs for partial resistance had been reported to be linked to complete blast resistance in previous studies. QTLs identified in greenhouse tests were good predictors of blast resistance at two field sites. This study illustrates the usefulness of RI lines for mapping a complex trait such as blast resistance and suggests that durable resistance in the traditional variety, Moroberekan, involves a complex of genes associated with both partial and complete resistance.},

Alternative approaches in mammals, relying on phylogenetic comparisons of pseudogene loci and fourfold degenerate codon positions, suffer from uncertainties in the actual number of generations separating the compared species and the inability to exclude biases associated with natural selection. Here we provide a direct and unbiased estimate of the nuclear mutation rate and its molecular spectrum with a set of C. elegans mutation-accumulation lines that reveal a mutation rate about tenfold higher than previous indirect estimates and an excess of insertions over deletions. Because deletions dominate patterns of C. elegans pseudogene variation, our observations indicate that natural selection might be significant in promoting small genome size, and challenge the prevalent assumption that pseudogene divergence accurately reflects the spontaneous mutation spectrum.},

The AvrLm1 avirulence gene was recently cloned and shown to be a solo gene within a 269 kb non-coding, heterochromatin-like region. Here we describe the sequencing of the AvrLm1 genomic region in one avirulent and two virulent isolates to investigate the molecular basis of evolution towards virulence at the AvrLm1 locus. For these virulent isolates, the gain of virulence was linked to a 260 kb deletion of a chromosomal segment spanning AvrLm1 and deletion breakpoints were identical or similar. Among the 460 isolates analysed from France, Australia and Mexico, a similar large deletion was apparent in {$>$} 90\% of the virulent isolates. Deletion breakpoints were also strongly conserved in most of the virulent isolates, which led to the hypothesis that a unique deletion event leading to the avrLm1 virulence has diffused in pathogen populations. These data finally suggest that retrotransposons are key drivers in genome evolution and adaptation to novel selection pressure in L. maculans.},

Sequence comparisons of an infectious cDNA clone of the UK 1 isolate of TuMV (avirulent on TuRB01) and a spontaneous mutant capable of infecting plants possessing TuRB01 suggested that a single nucleotide change in the cylindrical inclusion (CI) protein coding region (gene) of the virus was responsible for the altered phenotype. A second spontaneous mutation involved a different change in the CI gene. The construction of chimeric genomes and subsequent inoculations to plant lines segregating for TuRB01 confirmed the involvement of the CI gene in this interaction. Site-directed mutagenesis of the viral coat protein (CP) gene at the ninth nucleotide was carried out to investigate its interaction with TuRB01. The identity of this nucleotide in the CP gene did not affect the outcome of the viral infection. Both mutations identified in the CI gene caused amino acid changes in the C terminal third of the protein, outside any of the conserved sequences reported to be associated with helicase or cell-to-cell transport activities. This is the first example of a potyvirus CI gene acting as a determinant for a genotype-specific resistance interaction.},

Chimeras constructed with these cDNA clones showed that a single nucleotide change corresponding to an amino acid substitution (Arg119His) in the central part of the viral protein genome-linked (VPg) was involved in virulence toward the pot-1 resistance. On the other hand, 15 nucleotide changes corresponding to five putative amino acid differences in the same region of the VPg affected virulence toward the pvr2(1) and pvr2(2) resistances. Substitution models identified six and five codons within the central and C terminal parts of the VPg for PVY and for the related potyvirus Potato virus A, respectively, which undergo positive selection.

Using a reverse genetics approach with an infectious cDNA clone of PVY, we found that the region coding for the NIb protein (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) of PVY was the avirulence factor corresponding to Pvr4 and that a single nonsynonymous nucleotide substitution in that region, an adenosine to guanosine substitution at position 8,424 of the PVY genome (A(8424)G), was sufficient for virulence. This substitution imposed a high competitiveness cost to the virus against an avirulent PVY variant in plants devoid of Pvr4. In addition, during serial passages in susceptible pepper plants, the only observed possibility of the virulent mutant to increase its fitness was through the G(8424)A reversion, strengthening the high durability potential of the Pvr4 resistance. This is in accordance with the fact that the NIb protein is one of the most constrained proteins expressed by the PVY genome and, more generally, by Potyvirus spp., and with a previously developed model predicting the durability of virus resistances as a function of the evolutionary constraint applied on corresponding avirulence factors.},

Plant host-pathogen interactions provide good examples of coevolutionary systems where both numerical and genetic dynamics have been explicitly investigated in a spatial context and where genes under selection can be unambiguously identified. In this article, we focus on long-term studies of several natural host-pathogen interactions that span a range of life histories and taxa. We use these studies to evaluate some predictions for numerical and genetic patterns at local and regional scales. Specifically, we examine the degree of among-population asynchrony in disease presence/absence and abundance, and the extent to which this is a function of isolation. For one host-pathogen interaction (Linum-Melampsora), we focus on whether there is local correspondence between resistance and virulence genes (as would be predicted by single-population coevolutionary models) or whether such correspondence occurs at larger spatial scales. Finally, we discuss the implications of these studies with respect to the impact of host and pathogen life-history variation on the spatial scale of coevolutionary interactions. Understanding coevolutionary interactions in nature requires a multidisciplinary approach, including long-term empirical studies of multiple populations and computer modeling.},

  abstract = {Polygenic resistance is generally quantitative without clear race specific effects. With the onset of molecular markers technologies, the identification of chromosome regions that are involved in quantitative resistance has become feasible. These regions are designated quantitative trait loci (QTLs). The mapping of `major' QTLs can be independent of environment, season, year or race of the challenging pathogen. However, the detection of minor QTLs may be dependent on the `environment'. As QTLs are defined by the position on the genome and the quantitative effect on resistance, they are not informative about the mechanism of resistance. By comparing QTL with the loci that are involved in race specific resistance the coincidence of these loci may suggest a common mechanism. However, the histological characterisation of the resistance is more informative about the resistance mechanism. Estimations about the durability of polygenic, quantitative resistance are still academic as there is hardly any experience with large-scale usage of quantitative resistance over a longer period. The clearest example of non-durable resistance is race specific monogenic resistance that is associated with a hypersensitive response (HR). Hence, there is a great chance that polygenic resistance that is not associated with HR is more durable. In some pathosystems with a long experience with non-durable race specific HR genes, quantitative resistance offers a good alternative and marker-assisted breeding will facilitate the exploitation of these resistance for commercial purposes.},

During the 1950s and early 1960s, it was felt that synthetic fertilizers and pesticides could forever replace crop rotation without loss of yield, but that opinion has changed. The current consensus is that crop rotation increases yield and profit and allows for sustained production. For example, maize, in a 2-year rotation with soybean, yields 5 to 20\% more than continuous maize, and no amount of fertilizer or pesticide can compensate completely for that difference. It is not well understood what causes the rotation effect, but improvements in soil physical properties and soil organic matter probably play a beneficial role in rotations that include multiple years of sod, pasture, or hay. Short rotations such as maize-soybean actually result in a degradation in those same factors, yet the rotation effect still is realized. Recent information suggests that soilborne pathogens may be responsible for the yield depression seen with continuous monoculture.},

Growing evidence suggests that ecological intensification of mainstream farming can safeguard food production, with accompanying environmental benefits; however, the approach is rarely adopted by farmers. Our review of the evidence for replacing external inputs with ecosystem services shows that scientists tend to focus on processes (e.g., pollination) rather than outcomes (e.g., profits), and express benefits at spatio-temporal scales that are not always relevant to farmers. This results in mismatches in perceived benefits of ecological intensification between scientists and farmers, which hinders its uptake.

  abstract = {Despite their potential negative effects, parasites may be used as targets for biological conservation and studies on the evolutionary and ecological impact of parasitism. These purposes serve to increase our knowledge on the species diversity of parasites. In the present paper we try to precisely define the composite zoological group currently designated as 'helminths' and to address the question of how many known species there are in the different clades of parasitic worms, as compared with the other major groups described in the Animalia. The relationships between helminthology and nematology are discussed. Finally, the question of how to improve the organisation of research in these different fields of study is briefly considered. The Nematoda seems to be the group which needs the greatest effort in the future. This supposes that specialists in nematode taxonomy are numerous enough to maintain a substantial effort. The necessary taxonomical effort is weakened by the distribution of the fields of study between helminthology and nematology, something which is inadequate from a zoological, as well as from a logical, point of view. The study of nematode zoology would certainly improve if nematology could emerge as an undivided speciality. One of the prior goals in such a unified field of study would be an exhaustive inventory of the nominal living species. A cooperative effort will also be needed to found the basis of a general classification of the phylum Nematoda. Finally, a clarification and a standardisation of the terminology is also needed.},

  abstract = {The rhizosphere is a hot spot of microbial interactions as exudates released by plant roots are a main food source for microorganisms and a driving force of their population density and activities. The rhizosphere harbors many organisms that have a neutral effect on the plant, but also attracts organisms that exert deleterious or beneficial effects on the plant. Microorganisms that adversely affect plant growth and health are the pathogenic fungi, oomycetes, bacteria and nematodes. Most of the soilborne pathogens are adapted to grow and survive in the bulk soil, but the rhizosphere is the playground and infection court where the pathogen establishes a parasitic relationship with the plant. The rhizosphere is also a battlefield where the complex rhizosphere community, both microflora and microfauna, interact with pathogens and influence the outcome of pathogen infection. A wide range of microorganisms are beneficial to the plant and include nitrogen-fixing bacteria, endo- and ectomycorrhizal fungi, and plant growth-promoting bacteria and fungi. This review focuses on the population dynamics and activity of soilborne pathogens and beneficial microorganisms. Specific attention is given to mechanisms involved in the tripartite interactions between beneficial microorganisms, pathogens and the plant. We also discuss how agricultural practices affect pathogen and antagonist populations and how these practices can be adopted to promote plant growth and health.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The effectiveness of combining resistant tomato with BioAct WG (Purpureocillium lilacinum strain 251, Pl251) against Meloidogyne incognita was assessed in a tomato-cucumber rotation in a greenhouse over 2 years. Additionally, the enzymatic activity of the fungus, the percentage of fungal egg and juvenile parasitism, cardinal temperatures and the effect of water potential on mycelial growth and the soil receptivity to Pl251 were determined in vitro. RESULTS Plant resistance was the only factor that suppressed nematode and crop yield losses. Percentage of egg parasitism in plots treated with BioAct WG was less than 2.6\%. However, under in vitro conditions, Pl251 showed protease, lipase and chitinase activities and parasitised 94.5\% of eggs, but no juveniles. Cardinal temperatures were 14.2, 24\textendash{}26 and 35.4 \textdegree{}C. The maximum Pl251 mycelial growth was at -0.25 MPa and 25 \textdegree{}C. Soil temperatures and water potential in the greenhouse were in the range of the fungus. However, soil receptivity was lower in greenhouse soil, irrespective of sterilisation, than in sterilised sand. CONCLUSION Plant resistance was the only factor able to suppress nematode densities, disease severity and yield losses, and to protect the following cucumber crop. Environmental factors involved in soil receptivity could have negatively affected fungus effectiveness. \textcopyright{} 2016 Society of Chemical Industry},
